                A CSS class selector is used to style multiple HTML elements. They can be any element you want so long
                as you assign the elements the same class name.
            </p>

            <h2 id="another-id">Here's a separate ID selector</h2>

            <p class="CSS-class">
                And here is the same class name as the paragraph above the H2. Since they are both assigned the same
                class name they will both be styled with the same rules in your CSS StyleSheet.
