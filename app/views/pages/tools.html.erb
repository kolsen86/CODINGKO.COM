						The right tools can make or break a programmer or developer.  They can cut your time spent developing in half, solve common issues, or make your product really stand out.  There are tools for every language and technology.  This list will be continuously upgraded as I find tools that will help to make your (and my) life easier.

						<p id="editor-intro">
							A necessary tool in any programmers toolbox, text-editors and IDEs are where you will do most of your programming.  There are both downloadable text-editors or IDEs and ones you can use in your browser online. There are also free or paid versions of both.  Ass a beginner, I would recommend using the free ones, but as you progress, if you would like to try out a paid one that has more bells and whistles, then more power to you.  Briefly, I would like to point out the difference between an IDE and a text-editor.  A text-editor is sort of general purpose. It can be used for multiple languages through the use of plug-ins.  It can also be used for debugging and compiling with the right plug-ins, but none of these features come with it.  An IDE, on the other hand, is usually geared towards a particular language and comes with all the extensions, debuggers, and compilers among other things, that you would ever need for that particular language.  IDEs, also, usually have a much larger file size, and depending on your machine can be slow and laggy.  Ok!  Enough with the intro's.  Let's get into some tools.<br> <span>*As a side note, many of these offer the same features.  It is totally up to the programmer, which to use.  So, I am only going to give a description if there is some feature that sets it apart from the others.*</span>

									<p>
										Visual Studio Code is my personal favorite.  It has all the feature you could ever want, and if they don't provide the feature, you can pretty much guarantee there is a extension for it.  It has the features like autocomplete and intellisense and is highly customizable.  Plus, Microsoft updates it pretty regularly with new features.

									<p>
										Sublime text is the editor that I most see recommended.  I have used it, and functionally, it and Visual Studio Code are equals.  It offers many of the same plug-ins and features, so it's all preference with these.

										Notepad++ is a pretty bare bones text-editor.  It does have plug-ins available for it, but not nearly as many as some of the others.  If simplicity is your thing, then Notepad++ is for you.

												Code Pen is our first online text-editor.  These are usually only for developing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  They don't allow for plug-ins, but they do come with some extra features.  Code Pen is the most used of the online editors and is a fantastic product for whipping up some fast code.

						<h2>HTML Tools</h2>

						<p>
							Compared to other languages and web standards, HTML does not have alot of tools available.  There is "What You See Is What You Get"(WYSIWYG) editors, but not a whole lot after that.  WYSIWYG editors are, to me at least, all sort of the same, so I will not spend much time going over them.  Let's hop into some HTML tools and see what we have.

								<h3><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Dreamweaver</a></h3><img class="floater" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmks1qdth/image/upload/v1537910195/Dreamweaver.jpg" alt="Adobe Dreamweaver logo">

								<p>
									Adobe's Dreamweaver is one of the aformentioned "What You See Is What You Get" editors.  It is also, in my opinion, the best one.  Dreamweaver allows people with no coding skills to build websites visually instead of completly coding one from scratch.  However, Dreamweaver, also allows you to code with programming languages, if you so choose.  It has been around for quite some time and is one of the most well know "WYSIWYG" editors available today.  It is very feature-rich and can be intimidating for a beginner, but Adobe offers many tutorials to get you started.  A big drawback with this program is the fact that it is only available in Adobe's Creative Cloud.  So, you will need to pay a monthly subscription to use it.  If you have the cash, and don't want to learn how to program, then you can't go wrong with Dreamweaver.

									Dreamweaver is only one of many "WYSIWYG" editors available and since I think it's the best one, it gets the top spot.  Some of the other notable "WYSIWYG" editors include,

						<h2>HTML Minifiers</h2>
						<p>
							Once you have completed your website and are getting ready to put it online, you are going to want to get the very best performance you can get.  Every little thing you can do to maximize the perfomance of your website is important.  This is includes minifying your code.  Minifiers take your code and take out all of the whitespace.  So, every space, every indent, and every line break is removed.  This makes it incredibly difficult to understand, but gives you a nice little performance boost.  There are many of these available online or for download.  Also, only use the minifiers after you have completed your website.
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<h3><a href="http://minifycode.com/html-minifier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minify Code</a></h3>
								<p>At minifycode.com you simply copy and paste your HTML from your text editor to the website.  It will then go through and take out all the white-space, giving your website a smaller payload in the process.  Minify Code also has minifiers for CSS and JavaScript, so you can minify your whole website right from their website.  They also have a Beautifier available for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The beautifier does the opposite to your code and puts back all the white-space, as well as properly indents it and adds line breaks to make your code look, well, beautiful.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3><a href="https://kangax.github.io/html-minifier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML Minifier</a></h3>
								<p>HTML Minifier, by Kangax, is available for use online or can be downloaded from various package managers and ran from the command line.  This minifier has all of the same functionality of "Minify Code", but comes with many more options.  It is the best at what it does (minify code) and in benchmark tests verse other minifiers, compressed everything a bit more.  If you are a beginner, don't be intimidated by it's options and just use it as a plain old minifier, than you will be just fine.</p>

							<h2>CSS Tools</h2>
							<p>
								Unlike HTML, CSS has a boat load of helpful tools available for it.  These tools can help you with everything from picking the perfect color, to picking the perfect color pallete, to creating beautiful gradients for you, to creating animations for you.  Since there are so many high quality CSS tools available to anyone that wants to use them, I am going to list 3 a week.  So, check back every Tuesday for an updated list.  I have seperated the CSS tools in order of usage.  So, for instance, if you want to find tools that will help with colors, gradients, color palletes, etc, check in the colors section.  If you want tools to help with animations, check in the animations section, and so on and so forth.
