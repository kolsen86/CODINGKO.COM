						The right tools can make or break a programmer or developer.  They can cut your time spent developing in half, solve common issues, or make your product really stand out.  There are tools for every language and technology.  This list will be continuously upgraded as I find tools that will help to make your (and my) life easier.

						<p id="editor-intro">
							A necessary tool in any programmers toolbox, text-editors and IDEs are where you will do most of your programming.  There are both downloadable text-editors or IDEs and ones you can use in your browser online. There are also free or paid versions of both.  Ass a beginner, I would recommend using the free ones, but as you progress, if you would like to try out a paid one that has more bells and whistles, then more power to you.  Briefly, I would like to point out the difference between an IDE and a text-editor.  A text-editor is sort of general purpose. It can be used for multiple languages through the use of plug-ins.  It can also be used for debugging and compiling with the right plug-ins, but none of these features come with it.  An IDE, on the other hand, is usually geared towards a particular language and comes with all the extensions, debuggers, and compilers among other things, that you would ever need for that particular language.  IDEs, also, usually have a much larger file size, and depending on your machine can be slow and laggy.  Ok!  Enough with the intro's.  Let's get into some tools.<br> <span>*As a side note, many of these offer the same features.  It is totally up to the programmer, which to use.  So, I am only going to give a description if there is some feature that sets it apart from the others.*</span>

									<h2><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
										Visual Studio Code
									</a></h2><img class="floated" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmks1qdth/image/upload/v1531579248/vscode-min.png" alt="Visual Studio Code Logo" title="My personal favorite.">


									<p>
										Visual Studio Code is my personal favorite.  It has all the feature you could ever want, and if they don't provide the feature, you can pretty much guarantee there is a extension for it.  It has the features like autocomplete and intellisense and is highly customizable.  Plus, Microsoft updates it pretty regularly with new features.

									<p>
										Sublime text is the editor that I most see recommended.  I have used it, and functionally, it and Visual Studio Code are equals.  It offers many of the same plug-ins and features, so it's all preference with these.

									<p>
										Notepad++ is a pretty bare bones text-editor.  It does have plug-ins available for it, but not nearly as many as some of the others.  If simplicity is your thing, then Notepad++ is for you.

											<p>
												Code Pen is our first online text-editor.  These are usually only for developing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  They don't allow for plug-ins, but they do come with some extra features.  Code Pen is the most used of the online editors and is a fantastic product for whipping up some fast code.
