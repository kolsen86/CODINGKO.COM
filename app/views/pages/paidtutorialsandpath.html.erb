<br>
		<p id="path-intro">These Sites provide some other quality tutorials and links to other ones. They also tell you the order in which you should
		complete the tutorials. Basically the same thing I am doing here only with thier own set of tutorials to follow.</p>

					<h2 class="path-head"><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a></h2>

				</li>
<br>
				<p>The Odin project was actually provided me the very first pathway that I have done.  It has a ton of quality tutorials, but some of them are kind of dated.  Check them out, but make sure you stay tuned to codingko as I am in the process of making a step by step pathway for beginners myself.</p><br>

					<h2 class="path-head"><a href="https://bento.io/" target="_blank">Bento.io</a></h2>

				</li>
<br>
				<p>Bento.io is very similar to the Odin Project.  I have not gone all the way through thier pathway, and it has been awhile since I took a look, but I remember it having some quality material to go through.  As I said above though, stay tuned to codingko as I am working on a pathway for beginners as well.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
