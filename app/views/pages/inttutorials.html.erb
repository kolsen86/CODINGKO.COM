		<h2>Interactive Online Tutorials</h2>
<br>
		<p>If you are brand-new to programming, you should start right here. Most of these cover multiple languages and technologies,
		but don't get overwhelmed by the options. Just pick one of the languages that we covered earlier and STICK WITH IT! These
		are listed in order of how I think you should complete them, but they are all great. So LET'S HAVE A LOOK!!</p>
<br>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.codeacademy.com/" target="_blank">Code Academy</a>
				</li>
<br>
					<p>Code Academy offers free lessons that cover the basics of many different languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.
					As well as many more. It is a great place to get started learning how to code. They really ease you in to everything,
					starting out with the absolute basics. They also offer a paid version, but I wouldn't spend the money unless you have
					money to burn. If you just follow the pathway I, or others, have laid out for you, then you should be able to get the
					same education at very little cost.</p>
<br>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a>
				</li>
<br>
					<p>FreeCodeCamp is interchangeable with CodeAcademy as far as where you should start, as it eases you in very slowly as
					well. FreeCodeCamp is set up a bit different though, in that they have their own path set out for you with their own
					tutorials. Some of the great things about FreeCodeCamp are that they go much more in-depth with everything than CodeAcademy,
					they give you projects to add to your portfolio, you can earn a few different certificates from them, and once you finish
					all of their challenges they will set you up with a non-profit to volunteer for to get actual real world expierience.
					Once again THAT IS ALL FREE! The only drawback being that it takes a pretty long time to finish it all. I believe they
					estimate that in around a year you will be able to graduate from FreeCodeCamp.</p>
<br>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/" target="_blank">TutorialsPoint</a>
				</li>
<br>
					<p>Tutorials Point is not one that I have a whole lot of expierience with, but they sure do offer ALOT! They have tutorials
					for pretty much any language and framework. They even offer a service to hook you up with a tutor if you wish, you would
					have to pay the tutor however. Still that ain't half bad. Not only do they have tutorials for programming and development,
					but you can also get tutorials for math, foriegn languages, and a variety of other subjects.</p>
<br>
				<li>
					<a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>
				</li>
<br>
					<p>Dash from the people at General Assembly is a wonderful quick tutorial on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The company itself
					,General Assembly, is a for profit bootcamp, however they provide this nice, quick, and ffairly easy tutorial for free
					just to get you started on your journey through programming. This is one of the more fun ones, simply because it moves
					along so quickly but is loaded with information.</p>
<br>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.htmldog.com/" target="_blank">HTML dog</a>
				</li>
<br>
					<p>Another tutorial site with front-end development in mind. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tutorials are each broke up into
					beginner, intermediate, and advanced sections and they do a good job of covering all the topics.</p>
<br>
				<li>
					<a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flat Iron School</a>
				</li>
<br>
					<p>I stumbled across Flat Iron School while I was researching bootcamps. While their bootcamp is a paid service, they do
					offer a pretty in depth free beginners JavaScript course. They have their own IDE and everything for you to run the
					code.
				</p>
<br>
				<li>
					<a href="https://tutsplus.com/" target="_blank">Tuts Plus</a>
				</li>
<br>
					<p>Tuts Plus for some reason is one that I never start out looking for, but once I google a question I need answered or
					a tutorial I want to try they always pop up with quality content. Watch out though because quite a bit of their content
					is paid, but there are definitly some free gems of a tutorial on there as well.</p>
<br>
			<span>BONUS!!</span>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="_blank">Solo Learn</a>
				</li>
<br>
					<p>I call SoloLearn a bonus because it is more of a phone app, at least to me. They do have the lessons online though. They
					offer a pretty in depth explanation on many different languages and frameworks and has a very active community. After
					you complete one of their courses they give you a certificate you can print out, if you choose to. I wouldn't personally
					put it up against some of the other ones in this list, but as a phone app, it is the best of the best for learning to
					code.
