          <p>
            Unlike HTML, CSS has a boat load of helpful tools available for it. These tools can help you with
            everything from picking the perfect color, to picking the perfect color pallete, to creating beautiful
            gradients for you, to creating animations for you. Since there are so many high quality CSS tools available
            to anyone that wants to use them, I am going to list 3 a week. So, check back every Tuesday for an updated
            list. I have separated the CSS tools in order of usage. So, for instance, if you want to find tools that
            will help with colors, gradients, color palletes, etc, check in the colors section. If you want tools to
            help with animations, check in the animations section, and so on and so forth.

        <h3 id="color-pickers">Color Pickers</h3>

        <div id="color-picker-intro">

          <p>
            Color pickers are absolutely vital to any web developer or designer. There are thousands of colors in the
            spectrum, and these color pickers will help you find the perfect one. Many of these come with extra
            features for making gradients or color palletes. Some of them are feature rich and not necessarily
            recommend for novices, while some of them are just super simple color pickers. Any way you look at it, a
            good color picker is an essential tool in any developer or designers toolbox.

            <h3><a href="https://www.webpagefx.com/web-design/color-picker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Page FX</a></h3><img
              class="floater" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmks1qdth/image/upload/c_scale,w_413/v1538010184/webpagefxlogo.png"
              alt="WebPageFX logo">

            <p>
              Web Page FX's color picker is very simple and efficient. It gives you a slider on the side to pick your
              color, and a box in the middle to pick the shade. With their color picker you can also save a few of your
              colors and have them generate a simple color scheme for you. Other than just straight up color pickers,
              this is as simple as it gets.

            <h3><a href="http://hslpicker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HSL Color Picker</a></h3><img class="floater"

              alt="Image of a color wheel">

            <p>
              HSL color picker is slightly different than a regular color picker. HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and
              Lightness. So, it still allows you to pick your color, but it also allows you to pick how opaque it will
              be. Opaque is transparency. If you want something to show through a background color, you would want to
              set the opaqueness of it low. Anyways, this is another very simple one. All it does is let you pick
              colors and how opaque you want them, then generates the code for you to insert into your CSS stylesheet.

            <p>
              ColorDot is a little different than the other 2. It is still a simple color picker, but instead of having
              a box with shades or a slider to pick your color, you just move your mouse curser around the screen and
              it randomly generate different colors and shades as you move it. If you are unsure about what color you
              really want, then this could be a pretty cool little tool.

            <p>
              ElectronJS Color Picker is my favorite. It has 2 versions, an online color picker and a downloadable one.
              It offer the same features as the others plus some. If you have the downloadable version, as I do, than
              you can drag and drop the color you want right into PhotoShop or whatever photo editing software you use.
              It also gives you a color book, to save all the colors that you like, as well as many other features. It
              is about as full of features as your going to get for a color picker.

          <p>
            Gradients can take a plain website and make them look amazing... If properly done. It can be a real hassle
            trying to create a gradient on your own though. Lucky for us, some great people have created some tools
            online to make the process much simpler.

              alt=" The ColorZilla logo">

            <p>
              ColorZilla is one of the best all around tools for CSS. It has an online version, a Firefox extension,
              and a chrome extension. With ColorZilla you can no only make beautiful looking gradients, but it also has
              a color picker, an eyedropper tool (An eyedropper tool allows you to click on any color from any webpage
              and it will give you the RGB or HEX color codes for it.), and a color history file so you can remember
              all the colors you have used or want to use. It also has a webpage color analyzer, which takes a webpage
              that you chose and generate a color scheme for you based off the colors on the webpage. I often find
              myself using the ColorZilla Chrome extension when I see a color I want to use online. This is one of the
              best color tools available for free for CSS in my opinion.

              CSS Portal is really one stop shopping for CSS. It gives you the gradient generator, but it also gives
              you sooo much more. It has a section for CSS learning resources and quizzes to test your knowledge. It
              has a section for examples of things done with CSS for some inspiration. It has a whole collection of
              other CSS generators to help you. These generators include button generators, tooltip generators, menu
              generators, ribbon generators, and many more. Not only does it have allll of this, but you are also given
              tools to help convert different CSS lengths, a CSS code formatter, and a few other tools to assist you.
              IT ALSOOO, has tools to help you with HTML. So CSS Portal really is one stop shopping for most of your
              CSS needs and even some of your HTML needs.

            <p>
              uiGradients only does one thing, and that's gradients, but it does it well. If you are looking for a
              great looking gradient and don't need or want all the extras, then I recommend uiGradients. It gives you
              a whole host of pre-made gradients, as well as gradients made by other uiGradients members if you want to
              just choose a pre-made one. It has all of those gradients separated by color in a menu above the
              gradient, so you just pick the color that you want to be the dominant and then browse the great looking
              gradients that others have already made. You can also create your own with the help of their gradient
              generator and you can upload it to their site for others to see and use.

        <div id="color-palette-intro">

          <p>
            With all of these colors and gradients you are going to want a nice color palette. The colors of your
            website are the first thing people notice. You don't want to be all over the place with your colors. Just 3
            or 4 colors will do. With these color palette generators you will be able to take the color you chose with
            the color picker or the colors you used with the gradient generator, then input that (or those) color and
            PRESTO they will generate a color scheme for your website to make sure it is visually appealing.

            <p>
              Coolors is my personal favorite color palette generator. It is extremely simple to use. Just log in and
              start hitting the space bar until you see a color palette you like. Alternativly, if you have a color or
              2 in mind already, you can input them and then lock them in. Then just hit the space bar and it will
              generate you as many color palettes as you want off of the colors you have picked. You can also save your
              color palettes to your profile for later use or to share with others. You can also adjust the hue,
              brightness, saturation, as well as many other parts to your colors. I would highly recommend Coolors,
              especially for a beginner, for it's ease of use.

              color, a description of the color, alternatives to the color, a color blindness test, and of course
              complimentary colors for your color palette, among other things. It even gives you examples of your color
              in use as a text, a background color, and as a border color. If you want to get a good looking color

              Mudcube color sphere is a somewhat more intuitive way to generate a color palette for your website. You
              choose how many colors you want, it provides you that many dots on a color sphere, and you just drag the
              numbers around and the rest of the numbers follow to create a complimentary color palette for your
              project. After you find the colors palette you like, you can adjust the hue, saturation, and brightness

        <div id="color-theory-intro">

          <p>
            This is for the people that want to know how colors work with the human mind. Have you ever wondered why
            McDonalds has the Golden Arches or why Sprite always uses green, or why Pinterest's logo is red, or
            Facebook's is blue. It's not "Just Because", colors can invoke different emotions in people based on a
            number of different factors. Big corporations are more than aware of that and design their logos with
            certain colors to tap into those emotions. It's called color theory, and here is how you can learn about it
            and manipulate the human mind through color yourself.

              development and design. They cover everything from the types of colors to the 4 separate kinds of color
              schemes. They explain what tint, temperature, saturation, hue, and lightness all are and how you can use
              all of it to create a great looking website.
