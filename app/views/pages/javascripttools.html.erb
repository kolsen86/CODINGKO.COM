    <h2>JavaScript Tools</h2>

    <div id="js-tools-intro">

          <p>
            JavaScript is currently the most popular language available for use.  It's for good reason too!  JavaScript can do just about anything.  It's a major player in web development, and is also used in everything from A.I. to The Internet of Things (IOT).  Seeing as though the language itself is so popular and versatile, there is bound to be a lot of tools available for it, and sure enough there is.  There is a JavaScript tool for just about anything you can imagine.  So, let's hop right in and see what they are.

        <h2>JavaScript Animation Libraries and Tools</h2>

      <ul>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="http://velocityjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Velocity.js</a></h3><img class="floater" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmks1qdth/image/upload/v1541521578/velocity.jpg" alt="Velocity.js logo">
        <p>Velocity.js is meant to be a replacement for the JQuery function $.animate().  It advertises that JavaScript is falsely accused of being slow and that in reality, it is JQuery that is slow.  Velocity.js makes your animations run much faster, as compared to JQuery and is just as easy to implement.  You simply put $.velocity() in place of JQuery's $.animate() and your animations will be given a nice performance boost.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://animejs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anime.js</a></h3><img class="floater" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmks1qdth/image/upload/v1541521578/velocity.jpg" alt="anime.js logo">
        <p>
        Anime.js is advertised as "a flexible yet lightweight JavaScript animation library. It works with CSS, Individual Transforms, SVG, DOM attributes and JS Objects."  Anime.js was created to be a very lightweight animation library to add to your project.  It can give you additional features that you may not be able to achieve with CSS alone.  However, if you are trying to make large scale animations, you may be better suited looking elsewhere.

          <h3><a href="http://bouncejs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bounce.js</a></h3><img class="floater" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmks1qdth/image/upload/v1541781545/bounce-js-CSS-Animation-logo.png" alt="Bounce.js Logo">
          <p>
            Bounce.js is another tiny JavaScript animation library.  It only comes with 10 preset animations out of the box, but they are smooth and flawless animations.  Bounce.js focuses more on small animations such as fade ins, fade outs, and obviously bounces.  If you just need to liven up your website a bit with some small animations, then Bounce.js could be the library for you.

          <h3><a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D3.js</a></h3><img class="floater" src="" alt="D3.js Logo">
          <p>
            D3.js has been one of JavaScripts most used and popular animation libraries for a long time.  It is geared much more at 3d animations, but the animations you can make with D3.js are stunning.  D3.js is a bit more advanced than the rest of the libraries, but if web design is more your thing, then you have to give D3.js a go.  Because it is a bit more advance you will probably want to watch or read through a few tutorials. <a href="https://square.github.io/intro-to-d3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> are a <a href="https://www.dashingd3js.com/table-of-contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few</a> of <a href="http://www.tutorialsteacher.com/d3js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">them</a> to get you started.
