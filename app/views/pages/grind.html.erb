<div class="container-fluid daily-grind-intro">
<p>Something that was recomended to me a long time ago, and that I would recommend to anybody trying to learn any skill, is to keep a daily journal of your progress.  At least for me, keeping this journal keeps me honest and more motivated.  I make myself write in it (almost) every single day.  It wouldn't look very good if I was keeping the journal and everyday I just wrote "Didn't get anything done today", so it definitly helps out with making sure I stay on task.  Don't get me wrong though.  You will see quite a few entries that say "Didn't get anything done today", but they are few and far between.  Another nice thing about it, is that it is pretty amusing to look back and see how far you have come since you first started.  For me personally, I feel like I am lightyears ahead of where I was when I first started keeping this journal.  One more positive about it, is that any potential employers could take a peak at it and see how much work I, or you, have put in to learning everything.  So, enjoy reading my personal triumphs and failures.  As well as a bunch of other events that have taken place during my life in this timespan.</p>

<h4>Welcome</h4>
<p>I, Kenneth Olsen, WILL BECOME A FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER.  I am going to complete the Odin Project.
I will attempt to remember to log my daily progress in this journal.  I decided to learn how to program about
3 months ago.  I started with Python and worked my way through quite a few tutorials and a couple books such as
"Learn Python 3 the hard way" by Zed Shaw and "Automate the boring stuff" by Al Swiegart.  I just kept getting
stuck with certain aspects of it all.  So, I decided to look at some other languages and settled on "Ruby".
It was enough like Python that I felt I was picking it up easy, but different enough to feel fresh.  Anyhow,
Trying to learn Ruby is what got me to The Odin Project.
</p>
<h4March 27, 2018></h4>
<p>Started Odin Project.  I have A windows machine and tried to set up the run Linux on windows option.
     WHAT A PAIN IN THE ASS!!
    I don't think I have it set up properly but time will tell.
</p>
<h4>March 28, 2018</h4>
<p>Set up my Git account and started my first repository.  Had some trouble, but i think iI figured it out.
Also completed some of the reading of the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
Starting the CodeAcademy intro to HTML.  That should keep me busy for a while.
Finished the CodeAcademy Intro to HTML in about an hour and a half.  Not nearly as long as I thought
it was going to be.  What a pleasant surprise.  Now to start on the CodeAcademy intro to CSS.
Hopefully it goes as quick and smooth as HTML.
</p>
<h4>March 29, 2018</h4>
<p>  Returned to work after my 2 days off.  I've also been doing every coding app for android I can get my hands on.
A good app is called Sololearn.  Ive completed the Python, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, Java, and one more language
that I can’t think of at the moment.  But, now I'm back home and working on the intro to CSS on CodeAcademy again.
Just realized that I never actually finished the HTML on CodeAcademy.  They started making me try to pay for the
next portion yesterday, but today when I clicked it it let me start doing it again.  NOW the CodeAcademy HTML section
is done.  Back to work on the CSS section. Finally finished the intro to CSS.
</p>
<h4>March 30, 2018</h4>
<p>Just found out today that my grandmother doesn't have very long to live so I will not have the time to get in as
much work as I have been.  I am going to try to get an hour at least of practice in a night.  Tonight, I start the
HTML dog tutorial.  Wow that was a lot quicker than I thought it would be.  It was done in about a half hour.  I
actually, preferred that style of tutorial over the CodeAcademy one because you actually get to build the page.
I think when I have some extra time I'm going to build a blog for this instead of just recording it for myself.
Who knows, maybe if I'm successful with becoming a developer this journal could help out someone else that wants
to change careers.  Now to start on the HTML Dog CSS Beginner tutorial.  Well I am having issues all of a sudden
with getting my PC to load my files to the web-page, so I am going to have to come back to that tutorial.  Got
half way through the drawing the android bug tutorial, but I have to call it a night.
P.S.  I also did all my phone apps while at work.  You can pretty much count on that every day.
</p>
<h4>March 31, 2018</h4>
<p>Didn't actually get to work on The Odin Project at all today.  I had work in during the day and then after
work I went and spent time with my Grandmother who only has a few days left.  While I was at work I did put in
a couple hours of practice on my phone apps.  I also researched some blog tutorials so I can turn this into a blog.
Tomorrow I promise I'll be back at it though.  I actually did get a tiny bit of work in.  Not part of The Odin Project
though.  It’s a very cool website called Dash.  Basically, another walk-through of HTML and CSS but a very good one.
I would recommend it over CodeAcademy and HTML dog.
</p>
<h4>April 1st and 2nd, 2018</h4>
<p>Was sick the last few days so I haven't gotten too much done.  I did my apps while at work and briefly did some
reading and watched a few videos about HTML and CSS but that's about it.
</p>
<h4>April 3, 2018</h4>
<p>So, I have been doing a little research and I found a different course that I am going to do alongside the Odin Project.
It is called FreeCodeCamp, and it seems to have a lot of success stories.  I believe that the maker
of The Odin Project actually got his start from there, but don't quote me on that.  So, wish me luck!!!
Finished all of the HTML and CSS stuff.  Tomorrow I start on the jQuery.
</p>
<h4>April 4, 2018</h4>
<p>    Today was a lonnnnng day at work.  One of the reasons it was long is because I'm starting to get the itch to just
want to code all day.  I like that.  You can say you have a passion for this stuff all day, but once you get the itch
and it’s all you want to do I feel like that is really when "passion" is an acceptable word.  So, at work I did my usual
apps. I keep trying to find new and better ones, but all the actual good ones you have to pay for, so I find myself
going back over the topics I've already done. But, Oh Well.  Once I got home I started on the FreeCodeCamp. I finished
all the jQuery stuff and finished my first project, which was a tribute page for Winston Churchill. I think it went
pretty well, but we will see what kind of peer feedback I get.
</p>
<h4>April 5, 2018</h4>
<p>My Grandmother passed away today so I will not be getting much done while I get family stuff in order.
I did however do my normal apps at work.
</p>
<h4>April 6, 2018</h4>

I did however do my normal apps at work.

</p>
<h4>April 6, 2018</h4>
<p>
    I continued on the FreeCodeCamp.  I am temporarily skipping over the portfolio project as I don't feel that I
would be able to give it my full attention right now.  I am on the JavaScript portion of the class right now.  They
kicked it up a gear and took off the training wheels for this.  It is quite a bit harder but I am loving it.
So, I have been reading some blogs about the best way to learn to be a full stack developer and one thing keeps popping
up. It is a class on Udemy by Colt Steele called The Web Developer Bootcamp.  I am going to give it a shot because
quite a few reputable resources have recommended it.  Plus, it is only 11 dollars right now!!  You can’t beat that.

</p>
<h4>April 7, 2018</h4>
<p>
    I am continuing on with The Web Developer Bootcamp.  So far it is very informative, however I have already
progressed well past what he is teaching at this point.  It is still the beginning of it though and I know it will get
to stuff that will help me out soon. Also, I think my girlfriend is starting to get mad at me with how much time I am
spending doing all this.  I keep telling her that it is for the good of both of us because I definitely plan on making a
career out of this, but she doesn't understand.  I do need to try to make more time to do stuff with her though.  It is
just so hard to stop doing this when everything starts to click and you get in the zone.  I made it to section 3 which
is intro to HTML lesson 24.  Still stuff I already knew but definitely getting closer to the new stuff.  I do however
need to shut down for a while and go spend time with the old Ball And Chain.  Hopefully I'll be able to get back to
it in a little bit.  I went back to work and got up to the first assignment of intermediate HTML which was making a
pokemon data table. Finished it and looked beautiful.  I am officially signing off for tonight though.  Good night
Kenneth...... Good night to you as well Kenneth.

</p>
<h4>April 8 to April 10, 2018</h4>
<p>
   The last few days have been nuts for me.  I can honestly say that the 10th was the first day in months that I
did not sit down and try to get any work in.  But with my Grandmother passing away and family coming in I really did not
have the time.  Plus, my sister and her fiancé have come in from England and they are staying in the basement where I do
all my work.  But I can’t complain.  It is definitely nice to see them and I will just work extra hard after everything
is done.

</p>
<h4>April 11, 2018</h4>
<p>
    My sister is still in town but I kicked her out of the basement for a while so I could at least get in a couple of
hours of work. She understands though.  I have completed the HTML section on the Udemy class.  I did have a bit of
trouble with the form, but I believe that is because I left it half done a few days ago and when I went back I was a bit
lost.  But, I will catch back up.  Now I am starting on the CSS sections of the class.  I'll check back with my
progress before I sign off for the night.

</p>
<h4>April 12, 2018</h4>
<p>
Didn't have a chance to do much of anything today.  Had a dentist appointment early and when I got home the family
was sleeping in my computer room and they pretty much stayed there all day (sigh).

</p>
<h4>April 13, 2018</h4>
<p>
   Nothing really again today.  Was another family day.  Just got in a bit of research.
</p>
<h4>April 14, 2018</h4>
<p>
    My sis and her fiancé went and stayed at my cousins’ house for the night, so I got up bright and early at 5:30 am
and completed CodeAcademys build your own website, deploy your own website, and learn responsive design courses until
11:30 when they got back.  Now I am about to be kicked out of their room / my computer room for a while. Took my laptop
outside in the cold garage to try to get some done around 8:30. Ended up getting in the zone and staying out there till
the battery was about to die at about 11:30 pm.  I got about 20% of the way through CodeAcademy JavaScript lessons.

</p>
<h4>April 15, 2018</h4>
<p>
    My sister and her fiancé leave today.  I love them and will miss them but am definitely happy to get my computer
room back. I also had to work today, but I brought my laptop because I was working by myself.  I got about 50% through
CodeAcademy JavaScript lessons. Don't tell anyone I did that by the way.  I am home now and my sisters flight got
canceled so it looks like my computer room is going to be gone one more night unless my dad steps up and lets them stay
there.  Well I got to about 60% of the JavaScript done and now my sister and her fiance just showed back up. (sigh).
Thanks Dad! So, I am going to have to sign off again.  OH...  I also got way worse news. My girlfriends’ fuckin daughter
is moving back here next week.  This has been an absolutely awful day.  I got my room back, at least for the moment.  I
have been doing pretty good on the JavaScript lessons until I got to getters and setters.  I have to remember to go back
and study that because I was getting pretty confused. But for now I have skipped ahead to classes.  I'm done for the
night. Its walking dead time (I don't know why I still watch it as it has gotten awful).  I really need to go back
through the last few JavaScript lessons.

</p>
<h4>April 16, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Just got home from work.  While I was there I did my apps, however I am starting to run out of lessons on them so I
have to figure out some new good ones soon.  My sister left again this morning but her plane is stuck on the
terminal so it is still to be determined if I actually get my room back.  Something clicked and I am understanding
getters and setters and inheritance in the JavaScript lessons. I dont know how that happens because last night I was
completely stumped by it all but sitting down today I am getting it all.  Don’t understand how it happens, but I love it
when it does happen.  Almost done with the JavaScript lessons but running into another roadblock with the modules, so
I have to remember to go back and go over those again.

</p>
<h4>April 17, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Home from work.  Didn't get much done there today because it was busy plus I can’t find any more good apps
to learn from.  Anyways I am starting back up on the CodeAcademy JavaScript lessons.  I should finish them today.  I DID
IT!! Just finished the CodeAcademy lessons on JavaScript.  Now I am going to start on either the jQuery lessons or the
REACT lessons.  Well I ended up doing the Angular JS lessons.  These ones seem a bit buggier and not as well thought
out but I am still understanding.  I just finished the first portion of it now to section 2: Directives.  Got through
the directives part of the Angular lessons, but I have to sign off because my girlfriend is sick.  So, I have to make
food and all that good stuff.

</p>
<h4>April 18, 2018</h4>
<p>
Just got home from work.  Decided to just re do the JavaScript portion of the SoloLearn app.  I really
must be learning because I breezed through the entire lesson in about a half hour.  When I originally did it I believe
it took me a few days.  So that's pretty cool.  Now it’s time to start back on the Angular lessons on CodeAcademy.  Just
finished the Angular tutorial... it was not a very good one.  Plus, I just realized that the tutorial was for version 1.x
and the current version is 5.4 so it’s a bit dated.  I think I am going to do the tutorial on React.js now. I actually
really liked the React tutorial, but I have decided to put the brakes on that for now and learn more JavaScript
instead of frameworks. I will come back to it though.  So, I am going to read and do the exercises out of "You don't know
JS" by Kyle Simpson.  I will let you know how it goes. The book is for beginners of coding as well as JavaScript, so I
am going to skip the first chapter as I feel I am already pretty well versed in the absolute basics of programming.
Chapter 2 starts with actual JavaScript though.  so off I go.  Uhhhhhg I just spent the last like 2 hours trying to
configure an IDE specifically for my JavaScript.  I am trying out WebStorm by JetBrains.  I liked PyCharm by them so
I'm giving it a shot.  But it was a pain in the ass to get everything set up the way I want it.  But, it is all set
up and I’m ready to go.

</p>
<h4>April 19, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Just got home from work.  Because I am pretty much out of mobile phone apps instead of doing them on my
free time I've been just researching and reading up on different things.  But I am now going to check hackr.io for some
good JavaScript tutorials.  I am doing the javascript.info tutorial and have made it to the while loops.  All the
JavaScript tutorials are super boring, why can’t they have more like pythons’ tutorials?  Those were all pretty good.  Oh
well.  I am going to head back over to FreeCodeCamp and work through some more of their stuff because this one is going to bore
me to death.

</p>
<h4>April 20, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Today was pretty much the first nice day of the year so instead of spending it in my computer room I decided to take
a break for the day and enjoy the weather.  So, I basically just did yard work.  At night I did do some research on some
other potential languages to learn.  I liked the GO programming language as well as Elixir and Crystal.  But GO is the
only one that seems like it could potentially lead to a job as of now.

</p>
<h4>April 21, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Enrolled in yet another class.  Udacity's intro to JavaScript.  I really need to stop doing that and just focus on 1
tutorial or course at a time.  This one seems pretty good as well though.  Other than doing that I have spent what feels
like hours trying to get Webstorm to do automatic line breaks instead of just continuously scrolling to the side.  I
finally got it but there are still a few things wrong.  But it’s acceptable for now.

</p>
<h4>April 22 and 23, 2018</h4>
<p>
Did not really have the chance to do much the last couple days.  I had a work situation of which really pissed me off and a root canal so wasn't feeling to great.
</p>
<h4>April 24, 2018</h4>
<p>
Had to work all day... I am really starting to hate that place.  All the more reason to get going on the coding.  Today I didn't get much done as far as apps at work although I did try out C++ for a while and even though I just looked at the very very basic stuff it didn't seem as bad as people make it out to be.  Since I've been home though I tried watching my Udemy class for a while but even though it was highly recommended it is just moving along too slow for me.  So, I signed up for just one more.  It's a purely JavaScript course by Travesty Media.  The reviews made it sound like it might move along at a better pace and so far it seems pretty good.
</p>
<h4>April 25, 26, 27, 2018</h4>
<p>
I've been kind of slacking this week.  I have not felt good on top of it being extremely stressful at work.  Also, I am running out of tutorials that actually engage me.  I did sign up for a pluralsite account and that class has been alright, but I think I learn better from a book with examples that I can work along with.  I got to try finding a few good ones.
</p>
<h4>April 28, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Found a good book It's called JavaScript: From Novice to Ninja.  It is exactly what I wanted.  It sort of reminds me of Learn Python the Hard Way only for JavaScript.  I've worked at it for about 3 hours today and have made it to page 130 on functions.  I won’t be able to do much more of it today though because my girlfriend wants to watch some T.V. with me.  (Sigh) I'm not a huge fan of television, but I'm a pretty big fan of my girlfriend so I better do it.  Got to page 148 about variable hoisting.  Signing off for the night.
</p>
<h4>April 29, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Just got home from work.  HALF DAY TODAY!! I did get a little done at work, though all it was was resetting the python course on SoloLearn.  Now I'm home and have restarted on the book.  Have progressed through a few pages about callbacks in function, but I have to go cut the lawn now... Maybe one more page before I go do that.  I got back to it for about another hour and got into the chapter about objects.  I am getting sleepy though so I think it is time to log off for the night.
</p>
<h4April 30, 2018></h4>
<p>
Didn't get very much done today as I had to job search.  I am not one to normally complain about my job like this because I know everyone does, but I am being royally screwed at this place!!  I need to get out of there!  I did get a little bit done though.  Just some more stuff on objects and using functions with them.  I have made it to the part about JSON.  I promise I'll work double hard a couple days coming up
</p>
<h4>May 1, 2018</h4>
<p>
    I just job searched all day.  Will get back to it tomorrow.
</p>
<h4>May 2, 2018</h4>
<p>
Finally got back to it today.  But the very first thing I tried to do in the book took me like an hour and a half.  I am covering JSON now and I could not get my example to run for anything.  So I figured maybe PowerShell won’t let me do it and tried it in VSCode for about a half hour then I started thinking maybe I have to install JSON and spent about 20 minutes trying to figure that out.  When I finally went back and went over my code again I found a FRIGGIN ERRANT DOUBLE QUOTE!!  That's all the problem was.  I could kick myself.  But its all good and running know.
    REMINDER!!!!!!!   READ UP ON REGEX!!!!!
The book covers it a bit but from the looks of it I need some different stuff for it to work.  The book actually recommends going to a few different websites.  Finished that chapter.  I guess that was the end of the basics.  Now its saying that its time to start using it in the browser and the first chapter is about the DOM (Document Object Model).  I shall start on that tomorrow, but it is late now and my girlfriend just got home from work so it is time to sign off.

</p>
<h4>May 3, 2018</h4>
<p>
Haven't got much done today either.  This has been a bad week for my learning.  I am however working through the DOM chapter, but I have an awful headache and it is getting late so I probably won’t do a whole lot more.
    REMINDER!!!!!!!! LOOK UP MORE ABOUT THE DOM!!!!!

</p>
<h4>May 4, 2018</h4>
<p>
    MAY THE FOURTH BE WITH YOU!!  HAH happy Star Wars Day!
I didn't get anything done today, but I do have some potentially very good news!  I had a job interview today for doing maintenance at an apartment complex.  The interview went very well.  The property manager said if it was 100% up to him I would already have the job, but I have to go through 1 more interview on Monday with the maintenance director.  I am sure I'll get the job if I want it though.  Fun Fact about me.  Literally only 1 time in my life have I gone on a job interview and not got the job, and that 1 time was because the boss was a legit retard and was getting confused with my resume.  Anyways, the job pays about 4 dollars more an hour than I am making now and it is also a management training program.  Alllllsssssooooo I mentioned about my working on learning computer programming and such and the manager was thoroughly impressed.  I suppose you don't see many maintenance men that are tech savvy, so that was pretty awesome.  Anywho, after the interview I had to come home and do a bunch of yard work, so nothing got done today as far as educating myself.  Overall it was still a good day though.

</p>
<h4>May 5, 2018</h4>
<p>
 Woke up super early because the herniated disk in my neck was making the nerves in my arm hurt like a son of a bitch.  So I just went straight to the computer room and started working.  Finished chapter 6 which was introduction to the DOM and have started on chapter 7 which so far is about event handlers.  The DOM was a very boring chapter but this one seems much more fun.  I think I am actually starting to get close to the animating web pages part.  I am going to get back to it though.  I will check back in, in a little bit.  I made it through chapter 7 which was event handlers.  I think I need to go back and re check all my source code though because my quiz dojo does not look like the books.  I am leaving off at chapter 8 which is about forms.  It is a beautiful day out so I am gonna go walk the dog and get some other stuff done, but I shall be back later.  Today was a pretty exhausting day, but when the weather finally changes in Michigan then Damnit you go outside and enjoy it while you can.  I'm back to it for a little bit now.  Still in the forms chapter.  I made it about half way through chapter 8.  I am on page 304 now.  I'm chuggin right along with this book.  It is however time to relax and watch a movie with my girl.  Will be back tomorrow.
</p>
<h4>May 6, 2018</h4>
<p>
 Just got home from work.  Was a half day today, but I know that I am going to get called in.  I really hate that place.  I am starting back in on the Novice to Ninja book, starting back on the forms section.  Just finished chapter 8 about forms, but in the ninja quiz project I messed something up.  So, I have to go back through and see what happened.  I'm going to save that for later though.  Time to start on chapter 9 which is about The Window Object.  SOUNDS EXCITING!!!
I was being sarcastic when I wrote SOUNDS EXCITING!!!, but it actually was one of the better chapters.  I animated my first thing online! It was just a spinning red square but still had me pretty excited.  I am all the way to the Ninja Quiz portion of the chapter which is always at the end.  My girlfriend is getting mad at me though for being on here too long.  I really wish she would sit down and learn some of this with me.  I really do think she would enjoy at least the CSS part of it, but she refuses to even look at it.  So, I have to sign off for a while.  Probably be back in a little bit though to at least finish the chapter.

</p>

May 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Sorry I haven't recorded what I have been doin the last few days.  I have been doing some work on everything, it’s just been so sporadic that I haven't had a chance to record anything.  But on the 7, 8, 9th of May I basically just was trying to debug the code from the Novice to Ninja book.  Wellll nothing I did would work, so I managed to track down the source code for the project on GitHub.  I went as far as to copy and paste the code directly, so there is just something wrong with the code.  It ended up turning me off to the whole book.  If he has errors like that in his own source code I just wonder how reliable the rest of the book is at teaching me. So I went back to finishing the tutorials on General Assembly.  Well, I have moved past those tutorials on my own.  They were very boring and I already understood it all.  General Assembly was still a great resource for beginning to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but like I said I had already moved past what they were teaching.  So for the last few days up until May 12 I had just been trying to find other resources to learn from while getting in some practice just kind of on my own every day.
</p>
<h4>May 12, 2018</h4>
<p>
I am going back to square one.  The first JavaScript book recommended and the first one I had started "Eloquent JavaScript".  When I was first starting it seemed much too hard for me, even though it is for beginners.  But, now that I have some other practice under my belt, going back and looking at it now I feel I can grasp it much better.  So that is what I am going to be doing.  As an aside I just want to say that I have recently been going on the website Quora where you can ask questions about anything to professionals.  Some people are assholes and really don't want to help and just want to put you down for trying to learn, but others are very informative, understanding of a newbie, kind, and most importantly willing to help.  So, I am going to head their advice, FINISH THE WHOLE BOOK!!!!
            AFTER THE BOOK IS DONE START WORKING ON MY OWN PROJECTS!!!!!
Sorry for the all caps but I want to make sure that when I come back I see that and listen to it.  That is the only way I am truly going to learn it is by putting it to use.  So off I go to continue "Eloquent JavaScript".  I made it about halfway through chapter 2 today.  Stopping just after learning about the arrow function, which I have already learned a number of other times, but practice makes perfect!!  Reminder for tomorrow I AM AT RECURSION.

Happy Mother’s Day!!!!! I hope all the mothers have a great day today, even though this message won’t get to them because this journal is only on my computer for now!! LOL.  I probably won’t get a lot done today but I am going to sit down and try to get some done now. NOTE TO SELF: GO BACK AND DO CHAPTER 2 EXERCISES!!!!  Well I decided to try making my simple blog out of this here journal... I felt like I wanted to cry.  It feels like I haven't learned anything. I am going pretty much back to square one and gonna read an entire HTML and CSS book then back to Eloquent JavaScript, because I don't really know what else to do...

    Well I didn't let yesterday’s slump get to me.  I really just decided to go back to the basics.  So I am going through the book HTML5 for Dummies.  It is about 100 pages but it is advertised as 8 books in one and goes over HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, as well as some other stuff.  So back to basics it is.  I am about halfway done with the first section of the book covering just HTML5 at this point.
</p>
<h4>May 15, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Got home from work at about 5 and had to do some stuff for a woodworking project I am working on.  Around 7:30 got going on the book.  Learned a bunch of stuff I already knew, but I think I needed that.  Nothing was sticking when I tried to work on the project the other day.  But I did learn some new stuff, basically just some different input types for HTML5 though.  I finished the first section on HTML5 and am now moving on to CSS3.  This is where I feel I really needed some practice.  I made it to page 156 about @font-face.  Seems like a good place to stop for the night.  See You Tomorrow Kenneth.
</p>
<h4>May 16, 2018</h4>

Didn't get a whole lot done today.  I did however get past the main JavaScript part of free code camp.  So, I get to move on to Object Oriented Programming with JavaScript.  HOW EXCITING!!!
</p>
<h4>May 17, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Just got home from work, twas another exhausting day.  I had my fifth interview with the same place today though, so it sounds like I will have a new job soon.  Anyways, I finished up the OOP JavaScript section on FreeCodeCamp.  Now I am at the algorithm challenges which are quite a bit harder.  I am taking a break from that though and gonna go through some more of the book.  I did a little of the book, but I started the Upwork tutorial again too.  I usually don't like video tutorials, but this one seems better than even the Udemy classes that I actually paid for.  I gotta log off for a while though because its supposed to rain for a few days and I gotta get my lawn cut before that.  So, I will be back later.  I am back and I finally learnt one thing that I have been waiting to learn, and that's how to make stuff go to the other side of a web-page.  To clarify it is just putting some <div></div>'s in and in your CSS file instructing it to FLOAT: RIGHT; or left or whatever, but I am happy to finally get that piece of information.  I made it about halfway through the CSS portion of UPSKILL's Essential Web Development course.  I know I say this a lot but this is a good one.  Seriously this is the best one I have done yet, and ITS TOTALLY FREE!!!  Now I sound like an advertisement for them, but it is good.  There is still a whoooooole lot left of it though.  After the CSS portion I build a blog, of course walked through by them, and then there is the entire back end section with Ruby on Rails, and then a walk-through of building a fully operational website.  Tonight however, I am done.  So, Goodnight.
</p>
<h4>May 18, 2018</h4>
<p>
    I missed a day somewhere in here, just to let you know.  Anyway, I am home from work.  It felt like a super friggin long day.  I am starting on the Upskill tutorial.  I got through a bunch more of the CSS stuff and finished that section.  Now I am moving on to the first project which is something that I have wanted to do for a long time.  I AM FINALLY GOING TO TURN THIS INTO A BLOG!!!  I got through the first part and set up an account with AWS (Amazon Web Services.)  This section we are using Ruby on Rails too.  I never knew how quickly ROR can make thing happen.  I already have a few of the blog posts up but I am going to wait till tomorrow when I have more time to add more.  But still, HOW EXCITING!!
</p>
<h4>May 19, 2018</h4>

    This is my one day off a week.  I don't know why, but I just can’t sleep in anymore.  Used to be on my days off I could sleep till noon.  Now, I'm lucky if I sleep in past when my alarm would normally go off for work.  Oh Well, just gives me more time to study and practice my skills.  I am back on UpSkill's Web Developer course.  As I said before, this is definitely my favorite one that I have ever done.  I pretty much already have a fully functional blog that I plan on uploading alllllllllll this journal too in a little bit.  Which I am extremely excited for, for some reason.  I think I may be excited because when I post questions on sites like Quora.com and explain that I do practice every day I just am having trouble with a certain concept and things like that, always, without fail there is someone that tries to jump down my throat trying to tell me and everyone else that looks at the question that "There is no way you can practice for 2 hours every night.  If you work a full-time job and have a family, as you say, then you must be lying to us.".  Well No, I am not lying to you all.  I do practice for a few hours every day.  I am lucky enough to have a girlfriend that understands what I am trying to do, and since I actually enjoy doing this, I can get lost in the time and not realize that "Oh crap, I have been down here for 6 hours doing this.  I gotta stop and go to bed.".  Now that I am going to have this blog, I can shut up some of them, of course there will still be some that will accuse me of lying in the blog, but oh well, you can't please everyone.  I am still extremely excited to get it all up and running though.  So off I go to continue working on it.

Just got home from work.  I am still pumped from yesterday.  I haven't felt that good about trying to learn all this for a long time.  I know it was just converting VS Code to run the way I wanted it to and finally understanding how to use GitHub but those 2 things (especially the GitHub) actually made me pretty proud of myself.  I am glad I had a little victory like that after just last week feeling pretty down on myself about feeling like I'm not getting anywhere.  BUT, it is time to start back on the Upskill course.  I shall check back in later.  I am going much slower in the course now, but it is because I have to figure out how to do everything the way he is in the course.  Which means I have to convert everything he is doing from the virtual cloud machine of Cloud 9 to VS Code which isn't that bad, but what is hard is trying to go back in time and figure out how to install all the Ruby Gems from 4 years ago because this course was made in 2015.  I am loving it though, it is definitely giving me the opportunity to troubleshoot for myself.  I just spent a nice long time on stack overflow trying to figure it all out, but you know what I THINK I GOT IT!  Well I just wanted to check in and write that all before I forgot too.  I am off to do some more of the course.  So yes, just in case you were wondering, I did get it all figured out.  I have to say that I am pretty proud of myself.  I didn't get a whole lot more done though.  Just adding a home page with 1 headline on it so far.  Now that everything is set up properly though, I should be able to start cruising through the course again.  Once again, I cannot stress how much I love this course.  I definitely know I am actually learning instead of just copying or something.  It's late though, so off to bed I go.  Goodnight.

<h4>May 22 and 23, 2018</h4>
<p>
    So when I got home from work yesterday Windows 10 was ready to install there big spring update, now I have not had very good luck with these in the past.  It seems like every one of their big updates somehow break my computer and force me to spend a whole day trying to figure out how to fix it.  GUESS WHAT!!!??? Yesterday was no exception.  I started the process at about 6 o clock in the evening and by the time I was ready for bed it was still only at like 23% so I just said screw it and let it go over night.  Well, this morning when I woke it was only at 60%, so I did a little research on my old laptop and saw that there were plenty of people having the same issue.  So I took everything into my own hands and have figured out somethings, but I am still working at it.  It is 1:40 pm now and I started trying to fix everything at 9:30 am.  I am making some progress but this really pisses me off.  This is basically a brand-new computer, I just got it about 3 months ago.  Microsoft, I love you.  I have always been a windows guy, but you guys need to get your shit together and stop breaking computers with your updates.  I will check in again in a little bit.  Hopefully this will be fixed and I can do some work.  Oh, one more thing, I also woke up super friggin sick this morning.  So, the last thing I wanted to do is deal with all your crap Microsoft.  Well it is 3:45pm and it is still not fixed.  I had to go through about 20 different steps but I think it at least is going to get fixed.  It better because my brand-new laptop is taking forever to load anything and lagging really bad.  If this doesn't get fixed I am swearing off Microsoft for good.  It's 7pm and it is still not totally fixed, but like I said I am pretty sure I figured out how to make everything work.  I have been running a different program trying to make it straighten out the Windows Spring Update and reinstall it.  So, while it is still super laggy, I am going to try to get some of the course in.  Ohhhhh, I don't think I mentioned it but I am sick as hell today.  So, dealing with the stupid update and being sick has made it a pretty miserable day so far.  It is almost 8pm.  My computer works but is still being slow and laggy, but the update says it is 96% done.  I am feeling very very BLAHHHH, but I did get in a little of the course.  I added Twitter's Bootstrap to the website and a few other little tweaks.  I have to get up and move aroun a little bit or something though.  So, I am going to get up and take the dogs on a quick hike around the block and shower.  Hopefully when I am done my computer will be good to go and I can continue learning without being aggravated by having to watch every change I make happen on the computer 2 minutes later.  It is 10 pm the computer is finally done but now everything is still running super slow.  I SWEAR IF I EVER SEE BILL GATES WALKIN AROUND IM GONNA KICK HIM STRAIGHT IN THE NUTS!!!  Hopefully the slowness of it all is just stuff getting used to the big new update beacuse if it stays this bad I am gonna be pissed.  Anyways, I obviously did not get too much done today.  I will get back to work tomorrow though.
</p>
<h4>May 24, 2018</h4>
<p>
    So, the computer is finally fixed... I think.  I had to delete 2 separate anti viruses though.  Funny enough the only one that lets my computer work is plain old Windows defender.  Coupling that with Malwarebytes ought to do though.  Other than that, I ran late for a drug test for my potential new employer and the place friggin closed.  I got there at 7 on the dot and they were all walking out.  So, know I gotta drive way far away to another one and hope that everyone will understand.  Something just always seems to happen to me.  I got to run and do that though.  Hopefully it doesn't take long and I can get at least a little bit of the UpSkill course in today.
</p>
<h4>May 25, 2018</h4>
<p>
    So I went and got my drug test and all that taken care of last night.  Hopefully I will have a new job in a few weeks.  But, when I got home my computer was laggy and slow again, so I ran some tests.  It said my fast video memory, or something like that, was failing.  I contacted HP tech support since I have 9 months left on the warranty.  I had to stay up with this dude, who had control of my computer, till almost 1 am.  He was getting kind of creepy at the end.  I kept saying "OK, Dinesh thank you very much I got to go to bed now though", but he would not get the hell off my computer.  Eventually I just uninstalled all his LogMeIn stuff, but the way he was makes me a little scared he put in a back door or something to get into my computer.  Not like I have anything to hide or anything, but still.  Whatever he did appears to have worked though since my computer is passing all the tests now. So that’s good.  Home from work.  You will never guess who emailed me twice while I was there...  That's right Dinesh.  The creepy customer service person.  He wants to call me again at like 630 to finish up my computer.  Well I didn't have to deal with Dinesh again, but I did have to deal with 2 other ones.  Neither of them knew how to do anything.  I would have rather had creepy Dinesh back.  Anyhow, they got into my computer then looked around and seriously I can't stress this enough, DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!! So, for about 2 hours they did that, then one of them finally tells me that they are going to have to send me to tier level 2 customer service people, which I also would have to pay for, even though my computer is under warranty still.  So, I simply thanked them for their time and said no and made sure to tell them that I will try to figure it out on my own.  They tried to argue with me, but I just cut them off and uninstalled them from my system.  GUESS WHAT!!?? After about an hour I had my system running better than ever.  I am still angry though because I had planned on getting some serious work in tonight. I haven't really gone this long without doing anything since my sister and her fiance were in town.  Oh Well Though, It is fixed, so at least I know that starting, hopefully, tomorrow I will be able to get back to work on not only a fixed computer, but a better one.  I forgot to mention I did a bunch of optimizations as well, because I am awesome like that.  But I gotta sign off now. I will see you in the A.M.

<h4>May 26, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Just woke up.  I hate getting old.  I cannot sleep in no matter how hard I try anymore.  But, as I said before that at least gives me time to get some work done before everyone else wakes up.  So, for the first time in some time I get to start on the UpSkill course.  I have a bad feeling though that when I get in there and start goin that something else from that stupid update is going to have broken something I need, and I will probably spend another day setting everything back up.  Well, let us go see if that is going to be the case.  Off I go.  I'll check back in a little bit.
I called that.  I just spent the last hour having to re set up all my gems for ruby.  I think I got it though so I am off to give it another try.  Well so far so good.  I went through a whole section of the UpSkill course, starting the server worked, git worked, it saved all my progress, so everything seems to be in order.  I just have a feeling that something is going to sneak up and F*%k me when I least expect it to.  I've done about 6 more lectures and no issues so THAT'S AWESOME!!  I know this isn't very humble of me, but sometimes I really impress myself.  All those tech support guys didn't help at all, actually besides the first one, they actually hurt everything.  Then I decide to take over and BOOM! I have the computer running better than new.  Anyways, as I said I made it through about 6 lectures, mostly covering design.  I decided to veer off from the coursework a little bit.  He has everyone making a site called DevMatch, which matches developers to entrepreneurs, but I have always had this idea for a maintenance service that works specifically with rehabilitation patients and their physical therapists.  Basically, someone goes to therapy and then their therapist calls me at "Rehab Renovations"(This may not be the actual title, but its not bad) and we go to their house and put up grab bars, raised toilets, walk-in showers, and anything else that they would need to give them quality of life in their own home.  I have never seen a business like this and it fits right into my skill set.  So, I have veered off of his coursework, and while I am still doing the same things, I am making my business website instead of his.  I have to get off of here and go do some yard work though.  I shall be back later though.  I am back.  Did the lawn and then went and got some flowers and stuff for the yard.  It was miserable.  There were a billion people at the place we went and its 90 degrees and muggy.  I am glad to be home.  Now to get back to work for a little bit.  I am back.  I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.  I was sweating so bad and it was getting late so I just pushed through and by the time I only had a few lines left to cut I couldn't even focus.  I am alive though.  I made it.  I came back to work for a little bit and pretty much added an entire business page and about page to the website I am building with the help of UpSkill.  As I said, I definitely veered off from the project he has us doing, but mine is turning out pretty nice.  As far as a business goes, I think this one is a great idea too.  I really think I could make money with the idea.   By the way, I am sorry this blog has kind of turned into a journal of my life and not just about my journey to becoming a web developer, but I have found that it is a pretty good stress reliever to come down here and get some stuff off my chest.  I hope you, Dear Reader, don't mind    .... "Crickets".... HaHa there are no readers beside me!!  Well eventually hopefully there will be some readers, because it is still fully my intention to turn this into a blog.  It is time for me to sign off though, SO GOODNIGHT TO ALL MY READERS AND FANS ACROSS THE GLOBE!!!  HAHA I crack myself up.

    I just got home from work.  I am going to tell you something that I tell other people all the time but I don't think they believe me.  I would prefer -20 degrees and a foot of snow every day over 90 degrees and humid.  IT IS SOOOO FRIGGIN HOT OUT! I have probably lost like 5 gallons of water from my body in the last 2 days.  I am not supposed to be in this weather.  I have Viking ancestry.  All Danish and Swedish, give me cold weather all day, but please not this crap.  Anyways I am going to relax for just a few minutes and then get down to business on the UpSkill course.  I'll check back in a little bit.  I just finished the first half of the UpSkill course, which was pretty much just the front-end stuff.  Now we get to start on the back end.  I am going to go eat some lunch, but I will be back in a little bit.  So, after I ate lunch I went outside and did some yard work for a little bit and then came back and got going on the back-end stuff.  I made it through about 4 more lessons which was a lot of learning bootstrap for making forms.  I am just crazy tired today.  I know it's because of the heat, but normally no matter how shitty I feel or how shitty of a mood I am in, I love coming down here and working on all this.  For some reason today is a struggle though.  I am pushing through that and getting stuff done still.  I just don't like the feeling of not having fun right now.  I am gonna take a break for a little while, maybe for the night, so I can come back refreshed and roaring to go tomorrow.
    HOLY CRAP!! It has been 3 months since I started making this journal / blog.  I had started trying to learn Python prior to doing this, but as far as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, and a bunch of other stuff goes this marks 3 months.  So, I would like to take some time and reflect on what I have learned in this time.

    1.  I can tell you my typing has gottin 1000000% better.  I typed with my 2 index fingers when I started.  Now I am not quite good enough to not look at the keyboard all the time when I am typing, but I probably will be able too soon.  Also, I am a much much much faster typer than when I started and make a lot less mistakes.

    2. I could not have told you a single thing about HTML when I first started.  Now, I can confidently say that I am very capable with HTML.  It is one of the few things that I feel extremely comfortable with at this point.  I know it is probably the easiest of the front-end languages (actually probably the easiest of all the languages), but it still a nice accomplishment for me considering I started from absolute ground zero.

    3.  I know enough about basic syntax and structure with the main languages that, as long as it’s not something crazy and way different, I feel that I could pick up the absolute basics of a lot of languages rather quickly.

    4. I can make my projects look the way they are supposed to look with proper control flow.

    5. I know enough CSS that, along with HTML, I feel I could make some pretty good static sites.

    6. I probably know enough terminology to be able to at least understand most of a conversation with an experienced programmer.  Don't get me wrong, I would still sound like a total noob, but at least we would understand each other for the most part.

    7. I can ask a question the proper way on stack overflow.

    8. GITHUB!!  It took me until very recently, but I finally understand it and have gotten a few repositories going.  I was crazy excited when I finally learned this one, because I thought I would never understand how to make GitHub work.

    9. I know much of the vanilla JavaScript.  Not as well as the HTML and CSS, but I am working at it.

    10. I at least have a grasp of Ruby on Rails, but I still have to do alot more work with it to understand it better.

    11. Even though I have a Windows computer, I use the Linux Ubuntu Bash shell and have a pretty good understanding of it now.

    12. I had never really used Windows PowerShell prior to starting all this and I am very competent with it now.

I know there is a CRAP-TON more stuff that I have learned, but that is the basic gist of it.  I feel like I have come a long way since I first started, and I know I am still far off from turning this into a career, but I am still pretty proud of myself for what I have done so far and I am not stopping learning everything anytime soon.  As I said in the very first line of this journal I AM KENNETH OLSEN AND I WILL BECOME A WEB DEVELOPER!!  Ha did you notice I took the full-stack part off?  It is because the more I have read the more I realized that full-stack is kind of a myth.  Every web developer is pretty much full-stack in one way or another from what I understand.

Happy Memorial Day!!  I unfortunately had to work today but am home now.  Actually, I shouldn't say unfortunately I make double time and a half on holidays, but the best part of working holidays isssss....  I get to leave while my girlfriends family comes over!  I know that's not very nice of me, but some of them really really bug me.  The really unfortunate part of everything though is that they are still here.  Anyways, because of this unfortunate event, I probably will not get in as much work as I would like.  I am still going to get some in though, while I have the chance, so off I go.  I just did another big accomplishment for myself!!  Completely on my own I added an "Our Services" page to the website including setting up all the routes, controllers, nav-bar links, everything!!  I know that doesn't seem like much, but I did it without any hand holding or anything.  I did mess up once and thought I wrecked everything, but I did some research and figured out how to fix it with GitHub.  I fixed it and created a new one all on my own though.  That is exciting for me!  It really lets me know I am progressing.  After I am done with that website I am definitely coming back to making this a blog.  For really the first time since I started all this, this last week has made me think that I really just might be able to turn this into a career.  A CAREER I WILL LOVE ON TOP OF THAT!!  I never wanted to be a maintenance man and thinking that I might actually be able to dig myself out of that field makes me extremely happy.  It is late and time for bed though.  I will see you tomorrow.

Just got home from work.  It was another long miserably hot day.  This weather just makes me feel so crappy and crabby, and on top of that my cold or whatever it was feels like it's making a comeback.  I am going to relax for a few and get to work on my UpSkill course.  I got through a couple lessons.  Creating a database, which is something I have not experienced at all yet, so that's cool.  I got stuck for like 45 minutes though.  All it was, was a friggin end tag I forgot to put in to!!  I hate that, but at least it seems that every time I get stuck it seems to be something simple like a syntax error, but it sure is aggravating!  I am going to take a break for a bit and go outside and water all the flowers and stuff but I will be back in a little bit.
</p>
<h4>May 30, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Got home from work a couple hours ago.  I feel like garbage today.  I got some news at work too that just sort of leads to more stress even though most would look at it as good news.  So, as I have said in earlier posts, I am about to be getting a new job.  Well my boss offered me more money to stay today, but it's not in writing yet, which I am going to demand, and it is only 50 cents more than the other place is offering.  The thing is that normally I would probably still take the other job as I could potentially advance there and where I am at now I am not going to advance and I know that.  However, if I take that other job I feel like I am resigning to the fact that I am a maintenance man, which I don't want to be.  If I stay I can make a little more money and really stay focused on my work trying to learn development.  I want to bet on myself and just stay, but if I don't succeed than I may have blown an opportunity.  I passed on an opportunity to take a maintenance supervisor job about 6 months ago too and I don't think my girlfriend would like me passing another one.  I wish there was a way to know if this is going to be a path that I should keep taking, because other than me and kind of my dad I don't really think anyone believes I can self-teach myself this stuff and actually turn it into a career.  Anyways, even though I feel awful today I am going to try to get some work in.  Welp... All I got done was a little research.  Just kind of going over a little documentation for Bootstrap and GitHub.  Uhg. Hopefully I feel better tomorrow and can jam out a few lessons and maybe work a little bit on my extra stuff for the website.  I got to go to bed and try to get better though.  Goodnight.
</p>
<h4>May 31, 2018 and June 1, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Just got home from work.  I didn't do anything yesterday.  I didn't sleep a wink the night before, and really, I didn't last night either.  I am feeling pretty awful and delirious right now, but I am gonna push through and get some stuff done today.  I have to take some time and figure out how to rearrange my and my girl's room because we are getting like no air conditioning in there and it has been SUPER HUMID for the last few nights.  For now though I am going to get some stuff done.  I started actually creating a brand-new blog from ruby on rails and on VS code.  I did everything with very little help including linking it to GitHub, getting bootstrap, re setting up ruby on rails because the other tutorial had me using old versions of everything, so I set it up with all the new stuff.  I did a bunch more too.  I know if this was any other day I would be jumping around excited but seeing as though I have barely slept and feel like crap I don't really have any emotions lol.  I definitely got stuff done though.
</p>
<h4>June 2, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Just woke up.  I managed to sleep last night, but I still woke up early as hell.  You would think with home tired I am I would be able to sleep in, but noooo.  Oh well though, I’m off to go do some work on my projects.  So, I messed around and broke my blog.  That is ok though because I redid almost the entire thing and I am making it way better.  I restarted and added an about page and a contact page with the database and everything already.  Now I just have to put in the actual blog portion of it.  But, I have to go do some yard work for now.  I am back. Taking a break from the yard because I really still don't feel very good.  FreeCodeCamp has updated and has a crap-ton of new content, so I have gone through and refinished all the HTML and CSS portions of it and started on a different visual part that I can't remember what it's called, but that is pretty awesome.  Now when I start to get a little bored with the UpSkill course or building my blog I can do the FreeCodeCamp stuff again.  Oh, I forgot to mention, my girlfriend through a big old hissy fit this morning because I was smoking in the basement (Yes, I know it's a bad habit).  SHE AGREED TO IT THOUGH!!  AND NEVER HAD AN ISSUE UNTIL HER FUCKING DAUGHTER CAME HOME FROM COLLEGE!!  I know that's the real reason she throws the hissy fit's, because her daughter says she can smell it.  WELL YOU KNOW WHAT!??  I get one day off a week.  Saturday is the only day I can get up early and come down stairs and really knock some stuff out with all this.  If I am forced to go outside than that will totally disrupt my flow, so I am laying down a RESOUNDING "I don't care!", I am smoking in the basement, in the morning, for my one day off a week!  I know it's awful, but her daughter is supposed to be going to Florida for 2 months coming up really soon, and I CAN"T WAIT! LOL.  Enough of me being an asshole.  But, I am going to continue doing what we both agreed on months ago.  Sorry to vent like that. I got to go back out and finish the yard work though, so I'll be back in a little.  RIGHT AFTER I FINISH MY SMOKE! HAHA!  The lessons in FreeCodeCamp that are new are Applied Visual Design.  It's actually some pretty handy stuff.  I just got totally done with the yard and came inside and did a few of the lessons, but now it's time to go take a shower and get something to eat.  I'm sure I'll be back yet again though.  I got back to work and added all the content to the about page on my new blog web-site. Also, added a bunch of CSS and some more bootstrap and google fonts stuff.  I gotta say, all those people on Quora were right, building stuff instead of just going through tutorials is for sure helping me learn way quicker.  So Kudos to you Quora people.  It's about time I started building stuff though.  After I am done with the blog I am going to start working on a portfolio page so I can put my work online.  I need to start looking up prices for web-site hosting and domain names and stuff too.  I got to try to think of some domain names actually.  Hmmmm, K-O.com, KennethOlsen.com, webdevjourney.com, thecodingjourney.com?  It's got to be something catchy that people will remember.  How about K-Ocoding.com or coding-K-O.com.  I think I like coding-K-O.com.  It's my initials plus coding as the first word, so that way people that search for "coding" on google or whatever are more likely to see it.  I got to remember to see if that is available.  I got to go to bed though, because it's back to work for me in the morning.  Goodnight.

Just got home from work.  It was another exhausting day.  Let me tell you, we have a resident at my work (I'm the maintenance man at a nursing home that specializes in Alzheimer’s and Dementia, in case I haven’t mentioned it before.) that probably once a week he starts pissing in PTACs (A PTAC is a hotel style air conditioning / heater unit.).  I don't know why he does it, but it is really getting on my nerves.  Those are heavy and not very easy to change.  He did it today and as I was changing it out, alllllllll his piss flew out all over my shoes!!  UHG! Please anybody that reads this, give me a job in web development.  I am eager to learn and I promise you it will not be a mistake.  I can't handle getting pissy shoes anymore.  Anyways, I got a new app for my phone to kind of work on at work, but I have definitely moved past everything that it is teaching, but going over it all again can't hurt, so I worked on that at work.  Now, I am going to start back up on the FreeCodeCamp for a little bit and then do some work on my blog or the UpSkill course.  I'll check back in, in a little bit.  I did about 10 more of the FreeCodeCamp CSS lessons, then I had to run back to work to sharpen my lawnmower blade and oil it, and then of course put it back together.  When I was at work sharpening it I must not have been paying attention well enough and accidentally slipped my finger into the grinding wheel.  Thank god I caught it quick, or that would have been the end of my being able to type, but it just grazed me.  It still hurt though.  Then I had to water all the flowers.  I swear, I am constantly busy.  I suppose that's good though, because as they say "Idle hands are the work of the Devil".  I am done with everything though.  I am just going to take a break for a minute and then shower and then hopefully my girl will let me come back down and practice for a while.  Off I go, I'll be back in a little.  I got done with everything and came back downstairs.  I told my girl that I would only be down here for a short bit and then I'll come up and watch a movie.  Wellll, I accidentally stayed down here for almost 3 hours.  OOOPS.  I got back on the UpSkill course and instead of doing his project, I am going to try to apply the stuff he is teaching to my Blog/Journal website.  I figure I will actually learn alot more that way because not everything he is teaching translates super well to what I am doing.  For instance, I spent about an hour trying to fix something that he taught that would have been fine on his project, but on mine it made this little white strip in between the 2 Bootstrap containers we put in.  I had to look up and change like 4 things in my HTML and CSS, so I definitely am going to learn more this way and probably retain it much better.  Oh, and last night when I was looking up domain names and prices and hosting prices I found out that codingko.com, coding-k-o.com, kocoding.com, and k-o-coding.com are all available and so are all the other domain suffixes like.net, .us, and all the other ones.  As far as hosting goes, GoDaddy.com offers their basic package with a free domain name (for one year) for only 12$ dollars a year, and after the first year the price would go up to 24$ dollars a year because I would have to pay for the domain name.  Still, that's not a bad deal, actually it's the best one I have found.  So I'll probably go ahead and do that once this is a little closer to being deployable.  I gotta go to bed though.  Goodnight.

Well, I did it again.  I normally would wake up for work at 6:50AM.  I have today off work and woke up at 6:20AM (sigh).  I don't know why this is.  I am super tired, but there is no chance of going back to sleep.  Oh Well. I decided to be nice this morning.  Since it doesn't feel too bad outside I grabbed my laptop and came outside to sit on the deck and smoke.  Plus, this way I don't start off my day getting bitched at.  Anyways, I already completed some more of the FreeCodeCamp stuff this morning, but I think now I am going to work on applying some more of the UpSkill course to my Blog/Journal web-site.  So, I am going to go do that and I'll check back in, in a little bit.  I am working on my blog through the UpSkill course.  I just wanted to check back in really quick to remind myself to! REMINDER! GO BACK AND RESEARCH FLASH UPSKILL LESSON #65!  Ok, that's it, back to work.  I went outside to water the grass and flowers, and let me tell you first, I am OBSESSED with making sure I have the best-looking yard in the neighborhood.  All the old guys in the neighborhood try to keep up, but no matter what I always have the best-looking yard.  Number 2, I don't know how my dog craps sp much.  I just cleaned up the crap yesterday and there is at least 6 new poops out there.  It's friggin amazing! Anyways, back to work on the UpSkill course.  Oh!  I had another idea.  I am going to put all of my projects together in 1 website.  The Homepage for my blog/journal is going to be my professional portfolio, and on another page, I will put the blog.  I may put only that day’s blog post on the homepage too.  I figure that, that way either thing will get a lot more views.  People that come for the blog will also see my portfolio if they want to hire me, and likewise, people that came to see my portfolio will be able to see the blog, so they can see how much work I put in every day.  Sounds good to me at least!  I also have to create some social media accounts on Facebook, twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and any other ones that I can’t think of right now.  Now, I have always been a strong advocate against social media.  I think it depresses people, and I dont need everyone to see what I ate for dinner every day.  With doing all this though, I kind of need them.  I do think all the social media is good for business, but not so much to socialize.  I actually am pretty proud that I haven't had a social media presence in like 10 years.  All good things must come to an end though, so I better get on doing that too.  Awesome!! I just finished kind of the back-end development section of the UpSkill course.  So, I deployed my sight through Heroku and everything.  Obviously, there is still a lot of work to do before I can actually make it public, but still, PRETTY SWEET!  The last part of the UpSkill course doesn't really concern what I am doing (although I will be going back and finishing it for the other web-site project I was doing), so now the rest of everything I need to do for my blog is all on me.  Really, all I have to do is figure out how to add a blog page into an existing web-site, fix up the home/Portfolio page, and then just some CSS style stuff.  SWEET!  I forgot to check back in all day, so I will try to remember everything I did.  I know that I went outside and did more yard work.  Other than that, I styled my web-site a bit more.  I think I came up with my logo.  It will be <CODING>KO</.com>  I think that looks pretty alright.  I didn't realize I hadn't checked in since after the other BIG thing I got accomplished today, I finally got my entire blog page up and running on the web-site! So, know all I have to do is style it all, make some more content, add these blog posts in, and I am sure a butt load of other stuff that will take me months, but hey, at least I am really learning and building something on my own, and not far from deploying it.  I think that this is really going to help me eventually get hired by someone.  After a few more projects that I can put on the Portfolio page of the web-site.  Then, whoever my potential employer might be will be able to see some projects and see all the work I put in everyday on the Blog part of the web-site.  I really feel like I am making a whole, whole lot of progress in the last few weeks.  I don't feel like I am very employable yet, but I feel like I am not as far off as I would have thought I would have been at, at this point.  Plus, if any potential employers read this, then maybe they would recognize that with some better structure to my learning, I could be a decent developer in pretty short order.  A potentially great developer after a bit more of an extended time frame and the right teacher.  "Wink, Wink"  <<<< I'm looking at you potential employer, who is reading this right now.  Why don't you shoot on over to the contact page and leave me a message about becoming your employee!  HAH.  In all seriousness, whoever you are that eventually hires me, I can and will promise you that it will not be a mistake.  I gotta go to bed though.  I accidentally just did that thing again, where I am just doing stuff, and in the zone.  Thinking that I have only been down here for an hour, but really, it's been 3 hours.  I know I did it because my girlfriend came down and informed me again.  So, Goodnight to everyone that will be able to read this soon, but can't yet!

Just got home from work.  I decided to day that I am going to bet on myself.  I am staying at the job I currently have instead of taking that other supervisor position.  The pay wasn't that much better and if I took it I know I would not have had much time at all to practice and learn all my development and programming stuff, so I am betting on myself getting good enough doing this to at least be able to do some freelance work.  Ideally, I would be able to get a real job doing this, but even if I can just make enough side cash I'll be able to justify my decision to my girlfriend and family, because they are not going to be very happy.  Anyways, I remembered another page I want to add to my website. It's the tutorials page.  I want to be able to help anyone that may come to my website sift through the thousands of tutorials online and cut right to the good ones, because let me tell you, there are A LOT of tutorials online, and A LOT of them are not very good.  So, if I can help someone else figure it all out then great.  After all, that is why I decided to try to get into this field, is to try to help people.  Oh, and just some side news, my girlfriend is being dumb.  I can't stand it when she (or anyone for that matter) does this.  "I have some kind of shitty news, I'll tell you about it later".  YOU KNOW WHAT!!??  MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST WAIT TO EVEN SAY "I have bad news" TILL LATER!!!!  THAT WAY I'M NOT SITTING HERE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY WORRYING ABOUT WHAT IT IS!  Another thing she did, right in the same sentence is "Oh and Corinne (Corinne is her daughter) made it safe to Florida, thanks for asking".  I have been AT WORK ALL DAY.  Sorry it was busy and I couldn't spend my day chatting with you.  I guess I would just assume if something bad did happen YOU WOULD FRIGGIN TELL ME ABOUT IT!!!  Sorry about the venting, I just get really aggravated with the way some people communicate.  That is pretty much why I don't really communicate with people.  I am a quiet person, but only because I don't like small meaningless talk.  If I am talking it is because I have something to say that is either interesting, or important.  I don't like talking just for the sake of talking.  GEEEEZE. It's time to get to work though. I'll check back in, in a little bit.

    Hey! Look at that.  I'm on my phone at work right now.  I just got my Google drive on my phone going, so now I can make notes and stuff in my developer journal whenever I want!  Awesome!  I wanted to do this because I am constantly thinking of stuff at work that I want to remember when I get home, and without fail, I always forget.  I want to remember to add another page to my website for tutorials that helped me, because it's tough sifting through all the tutorials online.  There is just so many of them, and so many are not of very good quality, or are advertised as "for beginners" when actually it's just the first chapter is for beginners and then it jumps into advanced stuff way to quick.  Well, I just want to lay out some of the ones that worked best for me (being a total beginner all the way up to now, which I would probably call intermediate).  If coming to my web-site can help out other people, then that would be great.  After all, that is what really got me started on my journey, is being able to, or at least trying to, help people.  Lunch is almost over though.  So, I'll check back in later, probably not till I get home, unless I think of something I have to remember.  So I'll talk to you later.

    Ha I figured out how to use google drive on my phone at work earlier and wrote that, and then forgot I wrote it, and just now remembered I wrote it.  So, I figured I would share it even though I basically already wrote the same thing above it.  YOUR WELCOME.  I didn't get as much done today as I wanted too, but I did some styling and adding navbars and indentations, and a few other things.  My girlfriend wants to hang out for a bit now though.  OH! Did I mention what her bad news that was going to ruin my day was!!??  It was simply that she is going to have to work an hour later on Tuesdays.  That's it.  That's all it was.  HAHA.  Anyways, I better go hang out, so I'll catch y'all on the flip side.  Do people still say that? I don’t know.  Goodnight.

    Just got home from work.  I spent a lot of the day at work trying to think of some ideas or looking around for inspiration for the landing page of the web-site.  I also am going to try to pick up the habit of carrying a little notebook and pen with me for when inspiration strikes.  I jotted down some pretty decent ideas today, so I have a pretty good idea of what I want my homepage to look like.  Other than that, it was just a pretty normal busy day.  Time to get to work though.  So I spent allllllll day doing 2 friggin things and neither of them worked.  One of them actually broke the website, so I had to spend a bit of time figuring that out and then just used GitHub to take it back to yesterday.  All day, and nothing accomplished.  I guess though, if you want to spin a positive on it, I learned a whole bunch of what not to do.  Some people might even say that knowing how not to mess everything up is an important skill, I suppose.  Even so, I need to have another good day like I was having for the last few weeks.  I did make some deadlines for to get things done to try to push myself.  I don't have all the details in front of me, but I know my final deadline is July 1st.  I am crazy tired and it's late though.  So I 'll be back tomorrow.

Home from work.  I stayed pretty friggin busy there, but I did start doing some research on CSS selectors while I was there and writing it all in my little notebook.  Also, I have a buddy at work that is a super talented artist. He has actually drawn for DC comics before.  Well, I'm trying to get him to take a cue from me and follow his dream and what he is good at.  So, I'm going to build him a website next so he can showcase his work and such, and he is going to illustrate some stuff for me for my web-site.  Sounds like a pretty good trade to me.  Actually, I wouldn't mind going into business with him, if I can talk him into learning how to do CSS down the road, because he is as talented an artist as I have ever seen.  He has got that creative mind, so putting him in charge of CSS could be do wonders for him and I.  It's time to get to work on my stuff though.  Check back in a little bit.  I almost had as bad a day as yesterday.  I had to reset everything from GitHub once and then almost another time, but I fixed the problems.  Both were Gems for older versions of rails.  But then, I figured out how to style the <% yield %> tags in CSS, so that made it a somewhat more bearable day.  IDEA>>> It might be stupid or obvious to some other people that read this, but I'm thinking of putting up some actual tutorials for total noobs.  Little things like how to style the yield tag.  I bet it would help quite a few beginners actually.  But!! My girlfriend is yelling at me.  So got to go.

<h4>June 8, 2018</h4>
<p>
    Got home from work about a half hour ago.  Today was pretty exhausting.  It was a painting day, allllll day.  I started going through the Ruby on Rails documentation while at work and writing down important things to remember in my little notebook, and I looked up some Web Development companies around Detroit to try to see what kind of technologies they use, so I can know where to focus after I am done with my web-site.  One company in particular sounded amazing, and from the looks of it is the kind of company I would love to work for WHEN I finally break into the industry.  They are Platinum Innovations.  They look like what you see in the movies.  Like the type of place that would encourage you to bring in your skateboard and board around the office instead of walking.  Well, I found them very intriguing, so I emailed them.  I just told them a little about me and asked if they might have time to let me visit their office and ask a few questions and stuff.  I am really not expecting to hear anything back, but it would be pretty friggin awesome if they did.  I could possibly leverage a visit with them into a job down the road.  I told them that I would like to just ask them a few questions about what technologies they think I should try to learn, and what the best way to go about learning them may be and stuff.  I tried something similar to this awhile back, but then I was asking if they would teach me in exchange for maintenance work around their office.  I think that may have been coming on too hard, so I am hoping just asking to visit goes over a bit better.  It would be awesome if they responded.  Anyways,  it is time to get to work on my project.  I'll check back in, in a little bit.  Ok, I need to learn how to use GitHub a little better.  This is the third day in a row that I have messed something up and needed to go back to my last commit, but I end up having to download my entire repository and then set everything up with a new repository.  It's just a pain in the butt and I know there is a way to go back to it, it's just I can't figure it out and all the answers on Stack Overflow and stuff never seem to work.  Anyway, I got my project back and then managed to add some authentication and pagination to my admin panel and my posts page.  It's good that I am learning more of the back-end stuff, but I really need to get on styling everything, because the site still looks like garbage.  After I get all this crap figured out though, which I am close to I think, the I can really focus on that.  I am about to go walk the dogs with my girlfriend though.  I might be able to get a little more done tonight, but I am not sure because it's pretty late.  I'll try though.  If not then goodnight.  Got back, did a couple FreeCodeCamp lessons, Getting Yelled at Right now.  Got to GO.

<h4>June 9, 2018</h4>

I am just now sitting down to write what I did today and it's already 10:30pm.  I did get quite a bit done though, it's just because I was being rushed to go do other stuff, so I kept having to hurry up and quit what I was doing and never ot a chance to write it down.  I kind of want to get rid of bootstrap on my website.  It makes it so hard for me to style anything.  I spent probably 2 hours just trying to get the header right before I finally said "Screw It” and got rid of the bootstrap container.  I did get my color palette down though.  I'm pretty sure I am going to stick with a sort of dark blue background and then bright orange writing.  It still looks super amateur though, but I think I need to focus on just getting it deployed.  I think I will feel better once it's finally online.  Other than that, I looked up some stuff about CSS animations because I have this cool idea where my "KO" logo is going to be hiding behind some mountains, and then peek out and run up to the screen.  If I can figure it out I think it'll be pretty awesome.  I got stopped in the middle of everything to go to a wedding, which was insanely boring.  When I got home I got to do a little more, but now my girl is acting sad.  So, I need to go hang out with her for a while.  I actually need to start going up there with her more often, but I just get stuck down here doing stuff and just don't realize the time.  I am going to go now though, but I'll be back in the morning.  Goodnight.

<h4>June 10, 2018</h4>

Well it's a rainy Sunday here in Detroit.  I had plans to go out and do yard work today, but oh well, doesn't look like that is going to happen.  I woke up super early again.  No matter what, I can never sleep in past 8am anymore.  I am truly envious of my girlfriend and everyone else, that on their days off, can sleep in till like noon.  So, I quietly got up at like 7:30 and grabbed my old laptop and went out to the garage (So my cigarette smoke didn't piss her off) and did some FreeCodeCamp.  I completed 2 of the sections, I think they were Applied Visual Design, and CSS Flexbox, I almost finished CSS Grid to.  When my girl finally got up I got to come back inside.  So, here I am, back downstairs, on a rainy Sunday, so all I really have to do today is work on my development stuff.  SOUNDS GOOD TO ME! I'll check back in later.  It is now 10pm.  I have been waiting for a day like today.  Everything started to flow again and I made a whole, whole lot of program on the web page.  I also had a lot more time to work on it today to though.  That's why I need to just get a job doing this.  It takes a minute to get the juices flowing, but once they are, they flow good.  I got a picture of me finally up there, and a few other ones.  I fixed a whoel lot of layout stuff and styled a bunch more stuff.  It is actually starting to look really good.  I still have a lot of work to do though, but I have been waiting for a day like today for like 2 weeks.  I am definitely starting to understand how to get the layout going the way I want it to by using Position: relative and then setting the top, bottom, left, and right.  I even started learning how to manipulate photos today, that was pretty fun.  I also talked to my sister today, and she also thinks, like her fiance, that I might be wasting my time.  He is a WordPress guy, so he thinks that all websites should be built with that.  Well, I guess, yeah.  If you want every website online to look the same with nothing custom, no custom animations, and just bland static pages like we are in the mid-nineties.  That's why it aggravates me to talk to her sometimes though, because she definitely thinks she knows everything, because she is the social media manager for Barclays bank in England.  I will admit that getting a high paying job doing this is not going to be as easy as it was in the early two-thousands, but I don't need a 100,000$ a year job.  If I even make 60,000$ it'll be worth it to be doing something I love to do.  I gotta go shower and chill out with the old ball-n-chain though, so I may be back in a little bit, but if I am not, the Goodnight.

Today was a lonnnng Monday.  Not that it was crazy busy or anything, I just did not feel like moving today.  While I was at work I did a bunch of research and wrote it in my little notebook.  Mostly about CSS animations.  I have some pretty cool ideas of things I want to animate for the website, but I know there is no way I would have them done in time for my deadline, but I can add them after the fact.  I am going to get to work though, so I'll check in, in a little bit.  Uhg.  I swear I had good intentions to get stuff done today, then I had to go do a bunch of crap, then my girl needed help with a bunch of crap, then just everything seemed to break.  All I really got done is adding a gem called will paginate to my web-site that displays only a certain number of posts per page.  I guess it's better than nothing though.  It's late though, so I am going to bed.  Will be back tomorrow.

<h4>June 12, 2018</h4>

Just got home from work.  Another long day.  I was thinking at work about maybe adding a page for some other relevant information for programmers.  Where I could maybe put the headline from their news and a picture and load it onto my sight, so that people that want news can just one stop shop at my site.  I need to look up the legalities of that though.  I am going to get to work though.  So, I just spent literally the entire day just trying to solve one problem again.  Whoever designs some of this stuff needs to get punched in the dick.  All I wanted to do is make it so that the table that my blog posts get loaded to doesn't expand along with the content.  It seems like I see it in other places all the time.  Well, as far as I can tell in neither HTML or CSS do they allow you to fix the cell height.  You can set the width, but that is not what I wanted.  I searched everywhere looking for a solution and there were plenty of people asking the question, but no real answers.  That is, until I found it.  One random person on some obscure site answered the question and the solution seems simple, but it is not.  You basically have to override the table settings by making a style tag in the HTML and then setting the width, overflow, text-overflow and a couple other things I'll have to add in here later<<<<<<<<<<<<< REMEMBER TO ADD IN!!!!  Geeze though, now I have a headache from staring at the same problem for so long, but I am happy as a pig in shit to have finally gotten it.  Actually, I have been working on that problem for more than just today, it's just normally I give up and move on to something else.  I was determined today though.  I WAS GOING TO SOLVE THAT STUPID PROBLEM, and I did.  I would have never figured it out had I not decided that I was going to sit here till I did.  It is late and I gotta shower and get ready for bed though.  At least I got that accomplished today though, but watch, that will end up messing something else up.  I am not going to even look and see tonight because it will just piss me off if that's the case.  I am giving it a break for the rest of the night though. So, Goodnight.

Got home from work about an hour ago and was just looking around at some CSS generators I found while I was at work.  It seems like some pretty cool stuff, but I am not going to use any of them yet.  I did some more note taking in my little notebook while at work too.  It’s filling up fast.  I am going to have to get some more notebooks soon.  Also, something else happened while I was at work that pissed me off.  For the last 9 months we have been missing 1/3 of our department (and for 2 months of that time it was literally just me at work).  Well, my anniversary at work is coming up in a week and I have almost 80 hours of unused vacation time that I literally could not take, and it's supposed to be that if you don't use it, then you lose it lol.  Well, under the circumstances that I was in, I think it would only be right of them to pay me out that vacation time... DON'T YOU?? I mean, there was no way in hell I could have taken it.  So, I am contacting our corporate office in Tennessee to see if they can help me out, because that just isn't fair.  I know company policy and everything but given the circumstances they should break the rules on this one.  Anyways, it is time to get to work.  I'm back!  So, I had an easy day, but a productive day.  I added a bunch more tutorials to the site and started working on the layout for the tutorials page.  That page actually still has a lot to go, because as I said I want to add my own tutorials for some of the easier stuff so that beginners have someplace to go to learn the noobish stuff.  codingko.com is really shaping up to be a good site.  I'm not just tootin my own horn either.  It's the type of site that I have gone to plenty of times plus it has the extra minor tutorials.  I really need to get on researching SEO though.  Maybe I will do that tomorrow at work.  I hope that the site is pretty successful and that I can land a paying gig because of it.  I got to go hang out with my girl for a little bit though.  So, I'll be back tomorrow.  Goodnight.

    Got home from work about 2 hours ago, but I just wasn't feeling getting right to work today as I normally do.  I'm just tired today.  I did get some good news today though.  That vacation issue I was dealing with got resolved and they are going to pay me out for it.  Also, that company I was telling you about last week that I tried to get in contact with, get back in contact with me.  I asked them on Twitter if I they would consider hiring someone with no experience and they said "Sure depending on the role".  Well, like I said, I don't really think I am job ready yet, but I followed up with a question asking if they might let me visit their office and ask some questions.  I haven't gotten a response yet, but (especially because it's on twitter where everyone can see it) I have a good feeling that I will at the least get another response from them.  Even if the response is to say no, that might make me a bit more memorable for when I am ready.  I am going to try to get some work in now though, but I am not expecting much out of myself today because of the whole tired thing, and I don't want to force myself and start disliking this or something.  Off I GOOO!  I actually got quite a bit more done than I expected to.  Basically, just adding a bunch more content to the tutorials page though, so it was easy stuff that didn't require to much brain power.  I did come up with a pretty cool idea for a different navigation menu.  A light bulb with 5 thinking bubbles coming off of it and when someone hovers over one of the menu items the bulb turns on.  I am sure it's been done before, but still it's a pretty cool idea I think.  Even though it's only 9:15 I think I am done for the night though.  Like I said, I have been pretty sleepy all day.  I'll get back to it tomorrow though.  Oh, Fingers crossed about hearing back from that company that they will let me come visit.  Anyways, Goodnight!         REMINDER FOR TOMORROW>>>>>>SET ALL LINKS TO target"_blank"<<<<<<<

It is actually already the 16th of June as I am writing this.  I have been busy all day and haven't had a chance to write down anything.  I had to do allll the yard work today before the big storms we are supposed to get tomorrow.  All I really got done today is adding some more content to the tutorials page anyway.  I ran into a few problems though, and neither one is resolved yet.  First I tried to use the will paginate gem to paginate my tutorials page, but that wouldn't work.  I believe that somehow is what caused my second problem and that's that for whatever reason my localhost:3000 will not let me connect to it.  I think that when I tried to paginate my page that it got stuck in some sort of loop, and even after restarting my computer it wouldn't let me on.  So, I switched the port and it's working fine, but it was still very frustrating.  I am tired though and it's already 12:30AM.  I'm an old man now so staying up past 10PM makes me feel tired lol.  Anyways if it ends up storming and raining all day like it's supposed too I am sure I'll get a bunch more done tomorrow.  Off to bed I go though. Goodnight.

    It's Saturday and I have the day off.  I still woke up early as shit though.  So, for the last couple hours I have been sitting outside messing around with photo editing software like AdobeCC and GIMP.  I wish my girlfriend would learn how to do at least this stuff.  I think she would really enjoy it and it would give me more time to work on the actual website stuff, but she always says "I don't have the time to do it."  Well, I call BS on that.  I heard a quote one time that I loved and that is "Never say you don't have the time to do something, because you have the same amount of time as Einstein, Gandhi, and Edison."  That quote is so true too.  I basically live by that quote.  It makes sense.  If you want to do great things than you just have to use your time wisely.  You will rarely find me sitting around doing nothing, because I know how valuable my time is.  So, I try to spend every bit of my time trying to either better myself or accomplish something else.  Whether it be pulling weeds out in the yard, learning something more about programming or web development, or working on my website.  I ended up getting pretty busy the rest of the day.  Had to help clean out my gramma's storage unit, then went to my mom’s for a little bit, then had to get some work around the house done.  I did finally end up getting these pictures cropped the way I want them for the website and added a bunch more content to the tutorials part of me website.

Happy Father’s Day!!! Just got up, early as hell of course, so I have grabbed my computer and headed outside to get a bit of work in before I end up getting busy in a little bit with Father’s Day stuff.  HOLY BALLS IT'S HOT OUT TODAY!!!  On the bright side though, I just bought my girlfriend a pool yesterday and it is about ready to go.  So, when I get home from my dad's house I think I will be taking a dip in there.  Anyways, for the last little while I have been working on my site.  I added the "Tools" page which only comes off of my tutorials page and added a button (Which was a bigger pain in the ass than it probably should have been) to both the tutorials page and the tools page.  I also finally got those pictures cropped the way I want them for the new navigation menu I am going to build.  The site is Definity moving along.  I hope I can make the deadline I made for myself.  Speaking of the deadline, my girlfriend wanted to argue with me that it's a fake deadline so it doesn't matter if I reach it, so I have to take more time off to do stuff with her.  Which I do agree with, but after this deadline, because I feel that especially for my first few big projects like this, I need to buckle down and not slack off.  I really need to make my deadline just to prove to myself that I can and to actually get this accomplished.  She will understand, I hope.  Anyways, I got to get off of here for a little bit and get ready to head over to my dad's house, but I'll be back later.  Back from my dad's.  He is going to give me his old apple desktop.  Now, I have always been a Windows guy, but it might be good to learn a little bit about macs.  It's a bit old, I think from around 2006, but still.  I am going to try to get a bit more work in though before my girlfriend gets home and makes me do stuff.

I apologize for not having wrote in this journal at all this week.  It's not because I wasn't doing any work on my project or anything though.  Quite the contrary.  It is because I was doing too much work on my project that I haven't written at all.  Every day I have gotten involved so much in some part I was trying to get finished that I would lose track of time and end up getting yelled at.  So, I shall try to briefly summarize some of the stuff I have done the last few days.  I have gotten heavily involved with Photoshop and trying to edit certain pictures to look the way I want them too.  I have learned a lot about it too, unfortunately, I believe that the Photoshop I have is only a trial version.  So, I might get forced to go buy it.  I hate the way they have you buy things nowadays though.  You don't just purchase a product anymore.  Now you purchase a subscription to the product and have to pay like 50 dollars a month for it.  Anyways, I am almost done with my custom navigation menu.  It is going to be all my links in these bubbles and when you hover over a link, a fist pops out at your screen with the link written on the fist like it's a tattoo.  When you click on the link the first flies out at your screen and another picture of a broken screen pops up before taking you to the portion of the site you want to go to.  I think it will be pretty friggin cool.  I also started making a list of different subjects for me to actually give tutorials on.  Things like how to pick your first language and the difference between object-oriented and functional programming.  Like I said, I want this to be a site that beginners can go to to learn without fear of looking stupid.  Today I actually started on a different project, that I might do before finishing my site.  I am going to make a kitchen dashboard that displays the weather, traffic, and local news.  It will also have a calendar and a few other little widgets.  That is something that I have wanted to do for a while, I just never got around to doing it.  So, I found most of the API's that I will need and I already have the Raspberry Pi, so really, I could probably get that done in a couple hours.  SOOO, that is what I am going to go work on now.  I'll be back in a little bit, unless I get yelled at again.  Then I will be back tomorrow morning since I do not have work tomorrow.  WOOT! WOOT!
</p>
<h4>June 21, 2018</h4>

Welp.  I got yelled a last night, so I couldn't finish writing down everything I did, which, wasn't a whole lot.  I spent the rest of the night just trying to get my computer to connect to my Raspberry Pi, but I just could not figure it out.  I got it to connect this morning, but only in root mode, which I do not want.  So now I am completely starting over, all the way to the point of reinstalling the Raspbian OS on the Raspberry Pi.  It's all starting to aggravate me.  It should not be this hard to get this up and going.  To be honest with you, as far as the dashboard project goes, if it keeps giving me issues for even just an hour longer, I am probably going to stop messing with it and put that project on the shelf for a later date.  The OS is almost installed, so I am going to go try to figure that out.  I'll check in, in a little bit.
</p>
<h4>June 22, 2018</h4>
<p>
    I never got a chance to check back in last night.  Once again though it was because I was too busy with my projects and forgot to.  I had to go to my girlfriends’ son's birthday last night.  When I got home though I got a bunch done with the dashboard I am building (which isstill going to take me longer, but at least there was plenty of progress and learning).  Then last night while I was waiting for some packages to download on my Raspberry Pi, I started writing my first, sort of, opinion piece for my website.  I decided for my first piece to write "Understanding the Matrix.  Don't be Intimidated by it as a Beginner” and I have to say, that for a rough draft, it sounds pretty good.  I don't know if I have mentioned this before, but I have always had a gift for writing.  You probably can't tell through this journal, but that's because this is more of a jotting down ideas or things to remember journal.  It is just sort of my quick thoughts.  When I actually sit down to write a full piece it usually turns out very well.  Enough of tooting my own horn though.  It is my late day at work, so I had an opportunity to come down here and write a little bit, BUT, it is time to get ready for work.  So, I will check back in later when I get home, and also, I think I will be writing out a few more of my articles while at work.  I will create a new page for them when I get home and start adding them to the site soon.  So, I'll talk to you later.  Just got home from work.  I hate these late Fridays, they are so stupid.  Nothing ever happens after 4 o clock so I have no idea why they make us work till 6 on Fridays.  Anyways, I got a lot more done on the article I am writing, which is going to be the first article on my website.  It might be done actually, and I think it turned out pretty danged good.  I am off to try to get some work done at my dashboard though.  I really want to hurry up and get that done.

Today is probably the most miserable day I have had in a long time, and it is only going to get worse.  First of all, my computer, which is brand new, broke.  So, I have to reset it and lose everything from it.  Next its 110 degrees outside, and that's not Arizona dry heat, that's Michigan, you might as well be swimming because of how high the humidity is, heat.  It's absolutely miserable.  My girlfriend doesn't care about that though.  She is making me go on this stupid "Detroit Princess" cruise with her friends (who I do not like).  Not only that, but I have social anxiety disorder, it is pretty well known that I do too.  She is going to make me go on a boat (No escaping or walking away on a boat) with her friends (that I don't like to begin with).  Not a single one of them understands social anxiety, so when I try to get away because I feel like I am going to die, they try to follow because they think something is wrong.  No matter how many times I say "No, I am fine, I just need a breather", they feel like that is an invitation to sit down with me.  This type of shit ruins my entire weekend.  The computer being broke is definitely the icing on the cake though.  Good thing I have saved this journal too Google Drive.  It isn't current, so I lost about a week of things I have done, but that's manageable.  Thank god I also have my website saved on GitHub or this would have been way worse.  I really cannot stress enough how bad of a mood I am in.  Anyways, I'll check back in later if everything is fixed and if I am not overly stressed to the point of just completely shutting down.

So yesterday went just as bad as I thought it would.  I’m not going to get into it to much here, but it was friggin awful.  I got my computer reset and almost all the way back set up though, so that’s good.  I might even be able to get in a little work today.  I am just waiting on some things to finish installing and should be good to go.  I’ll try to check in later if I get everything going finally though.

Sorry I haven’t been keeping up with my journal again.  It has just been stressful around here and the heat is totally kickin my butt.  It has been around 100 degrees and super humid every single day.  It is totally miserable.  I finally got my computer fixed though, and I have been doing a lot of work on the website.  It is really close to being ready, I just have to make a few more tweaks.  I say that now, but I know I’ll end up working on it for like another 2 weeks.  I hate coming back to this journal after I don’t record anything for a few days.  I have done a crap ton but I don’t want to sit here and write it all out.  So, I am not. Lol.  I will get back to recording everything tomorrow for you though.  I am off to go do a few things to the website and then to water all the stuff outside.
</p>
<h4>July 6, 2018</h4>
<p>
Home from work and off for the weekend!  So hopefully I get a bunch of stuff done with the site.  HAH!  I doubt that will happen.  My girl already is trying to make plans for me for the weekend, plus, I kind of feel like crap.  I’ll do my best to get as much done as I can though.  I thought of something I want to do for the site too.  All it is, is taking the long list of tutorials and tools and making it so it only shows 2 or 3 per page and then add in pictures and stuff.  I am going to go get to work now though.
</p>
<h4>July 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 2018</h4>

I apologize again for not keeping up with my journal.  As I have said, I have been so into trying to get the website done that, that is really all I do when I get home from work.  Well, I don’t have work today because I have to go to my step-mothers moms funeral.  So, I am going to try to get some stuff done before that.  I have been losing my mind trying to come up with a color scheme for my website.  Every color scheme I pick always seems to look very amateurish to me.  I know I am still an amateur, but I want it to look professional obviously.  I have switched my color scheme around from black and orange, to black and white, to white orange and green and everything in between and I just can’t seem to land on a good looking one.  It is really, really bugging me.  So, I think today I am going to focus, not on the color scheme, but on finishing a bit more of the layout.  I have been wasting way too much time messing with colors, when I just need to finish it and worry about that last.  So, off I go to go do that.  I would say I’ll check back in later, but lately I have been forgetting to.  Once again, I apologize, but it is because I am working so hard on the website.

<h4>July 12, 13, 14, 2018</h4>
<p>
I FREAKING DID IT AGAIN!!!!  I’m sorry.  You know I love you.  LOL.  I have just been really busy on the website.  Everything is starting to just flow though now, and I love it.  I finally have learnt enough to not have to constantly be looking everything up online.  Actually, I have been able to do that for a while, it’s just that I still always did.  I just wanted to make sure that I didn’t break anything or something like that.  Now though, I don’t have to worry about it so much.  I have just been flowing and for the most part everything has been working.  Let me think on what I did for the last few days here.  I finally picked a color palette and stuck with it.  It’s a pretty simple one, but it looks good.  It is just a greyish-white background and charcoal black color for the lettering. For accent colors I have a darkish-blue that is the main one, then a whitesh-grey, and finally a gold type color.  It looks good and I am just happy that I finally picked a good one so I can stop worrying about it.  I also have been going back through my code and trying to get rid of any pixel measurements (which my entire code was measured in) and changing it to percentages, so my site would be responsive.  Then I loaded all my images for the tutorials pages in (there was 72 images I think), then I figured out that I should have compressed them all.  So, I had to go back through every single one and compress them.  I also shortened the URL for all of them.  Oh, and while I was changing the measurements I pretty much had to redesign everything because there is not a real guide on how to convert the pixels into percentages.  What else?  Oh, I changed the fonts up so I didn’t have 100 fonts for just 1 website.  Now I think I have 5 or 6 total.  I also found a great image hosting site named Cloudinary.  That site has a lot of great features.  Much better then Google Photos.  I even went out and bought Adobe Photoshop, but an older version (I think it is C6), that doesn’t make you pay for a subscription fee.  OOPS! I got to go.  I forgot I was supposed to go pick up my girlfriend about 20 minutes ago.  I should be back though.  I’m back, she wasn’t that mad.  Only because she was drunk though lol.  Something else that has been being discussed the last few days is a business that I have had an idea about for a while.  I think I wrote about it in here awhile ago actually.  I had already started creating the website for it before I started on my own personal website.  It is the Rehab Renovations idea though.  Basically, what it is, is that I would work directly with physical therapists.  They would go into a house and survey it for any work that would have to be done for an individual to be able to stay at home instead of going to a nursing home or something like that.  After the therapist goes in they would let me know what must be done.  Then I would go in and install anything they need such as grab bars, walk in showers, wheelchair ramps, wheelchair van lifts, and any other ramps or things like that.  I need to look into it but they may actually be able to charge their insurance company since I would be working directly with the therapists.  I don’t think it is a million-dollar idea, but I think it could be a live comfortably idea.  My girlfriend works for a doctor’s office and she brought the idea up to him the other day.  He and the nurse practitioner both said that they have never heard of anything like that before and that it is a great idea, and that they would definitely use me.  If I could get the therapy department at my current work to also sign on to the idea, then that would be enough clientele to get started already.  Obviously though, I still need to do a WHOLE, WHOLE lot of work to get that idea off the ground if I am going to do it.  According to almost everyone I have talked to about it though, it is a danged good idea.  I already have a couple of people that I currently work with interested in working with me if I do start it too.  In order for myself to get that started though, I would have to put this stuff on hold, and I really don’t want to do that.  I really love doing this stuff and I think I could make just as much money doing this if I keep going at it the way I have been for the past half a year.  I would also need to secure funding if I were to do that idea, and my credit is pretty awful so there is really no chance of getting a loan.  I would have to try to do something like a GoFundMe page and see what I could get.  I would need some pretty major insurance I would imagine, I would need all the equipment like grab bars and screws/ anchors and a bunch of other crap.  Not to mention I would really have to take a leap of faith and quit my job to do it, which would be pretty scary for a brand-new type of business.  I think that no matter what I am going to look in to it though and see what the costs might be to get started.  I wouldn’t have to advertise or anything because, as I said, I would have contracts with physical therapy establishments and not with the customers, so there would be no need for it.  I don’t know.  I hate getting my hopes up about stuff, only to get close and find out there is some major hurdle that I can’t jump.  So, all the work that I had put in would be for nothing.  That is really the number one thing I wanted to do even with learning coding and programming though, is to help people.  That would definitely be helping people.  It would absolutely feel good to come home everyday knowing that my work made it so someone else could stay home all day as well.  It’s something I am going to have to think on more for sure.  It’s late and time for bed though.  So hopefully I will remember to check in with you again tomorrow.  If I don’t though, just know that I am doing work on my website and am so involved with it that I really can’t take 10 minutes to write anything out.  That is really how it is too.  When I am on a roll, I can’t be stopped for anything lol.  Anywho, Goodnight.

<h4>July 15, 2018</h4>

  I am currently at work.  It's a Sunday, so I get to be here by myself. That can be a good thing, or that can be a bad thing.  It can be good because I don't get in to any projects, so if I have down time I can come back to my office and work on this stuff.  That is because I have no boss here or anything though. If he was here I obviously could not be on my computer.  It can be a bad thing to though.  There can sometimes be even more work on the weekends then there is during the weekdays, and with me being the only person here, it can get pretty hectic.  I have gotten some stuff done as far as my website though.  Really, I just added this entire "Daily Grind" sections in.  So alllll of the stuff I have written in this journal is now loaded in.  I am getting pretty excited at how close I am to being finished.  I say that now, but really I still have to do all the media query stuff and breakpoints and so on and so forth.  I have no expierience with all that yet, so it could potentially take me quite awhile to get it all good.  I am being summoned by the nurses though, so I gotta go do my job (sigh).  I will be back in a little bit though.  I'm still at work, but I only have 45 minutes left.  I had to sit down and take a break though.  It is super friggin hot again.  The weather channel just said that the heat index is at 112 degress!!!  Once again, that isn't the Arizona dry heat either.  This is the Michigan, super duper freaking humid heat.  The kind of heat that seriuosly makes it hard to breathe.  I swear to you, if I could move to Mars, I would in a heartbeat.  It would be perfect for someone like me.  Cold all the time, no people around to bug me, I could just sit back and relax in my space bubble with no worries in the world, except for falling space rocks, no oxygen outside my bubble, space radiation, and Martians.  Watch, it would be my luck that I would go to live on Mars and then suddenly the Martians decide to show themselves.  They would all be super annoying and want to hang out all the time.  Also, since they don't have much heat on Mars, they would constantly be coming over to my bubble, unannonced, and messing with my thermostat to make it 90 degrees in my bubble.  LOL.  Anyways, I got to go get back to work and finish everything up so I can get the hell out of here.  I'll probably check back in later.  I have been home from work for a few hours now.  I think I was close to dying before I got home.  That is seriously how hot it is out.  My girlfriend is actually out there mowing the lawn.  PHSYCHOPATH!!!!  I tried to stop her, but she just kept saying that it's gonna storm so it has to get done.  Well I sure as hell wasn't gonna do it today.  She knows I have Tuesday off and would have done it, so that's on her if she passes out. LOL. I'm joking.  Anyways, I started back on the website when I got home and got involved with a fancy new toy to put on the site.  A side navigation bar for all the tutorial pages.  I am close to being done with it, but there are a few things that I have to tweak to get it just right and I know that it will end up taking me a lot longer than I would have expected.  So, I decided to put that on the backburner and continue working on the rest of the site so I can finally get it done.  So, I am moving on to the style of the about page.  I'll be back later.
</p>
<h4>July 16, 2018</h4>
<p>
Let me apologize for not coming back last night when I said I would.  OK, apology accepted.  Thank You.  I am home from work on my lunch break.  I had to come home because it is even hotter than yesterday and I don't have air conditioning in my car.  I was not about to sit in that oven and roast to death.  So I figured I would come home and get in like 15 minutes of work on the website.  So, I am going to go do that.  I'll check back in later.  In the little 15 minutes I was able to work on it I actually got quite a bit done to my about page, but it is time to go back to the hell that I call work.  I'll be back later.  Home from work.  Work wise, it wasn't that awful of a day.  Heat-wise, it was the worst day of my life.  I can't believe how hot it ha been lately.  I am sure I have said this before, but I will take a -40 degree Michigan day over a 95 degree Michigan day every day of the week.  I have Norse heritage (All my Danes and Swedes what's uuuuup!!!) and we weren't built for weather like this.  Thank goodness I am home now though and I have tomorow off of work.  I do not think I will be leaving my house at all in that time.  If I put enough work in on the website there is actually a decent chance of finishing it by tomorow night.  At least the regular laptop portion.  I will have to do all the media queries and breakpoints still.  I have been doing a bit of research on how to do it, but I still think that doing all that might take me some time because I haven't done it before.  Definitly something I need to learn though.  So I am off to continue working.  I'll try to check back later with my progress.
