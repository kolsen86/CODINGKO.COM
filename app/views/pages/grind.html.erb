            Something that was recommended to me a long time ago, and that I would recommend to anybody trying to learn
            any skill, is to keep a daily journal of your progress. At least for me, keeping this journal keeps me
            honest and more motivated. I make myself write in it (almost) every single day. It wouldn't look very good
            if I was keeping the journal and everyday I just wrote "Didn't get anything done today", so it definitely
            helps out with making sure I stay on task. Don't get me wrong though. You will see quite a few entries that
            say "Didn't get anything done today", but they are few and far between. Another nice thing about it, is
            that it is pretty amusing to look back and see how far you have come since you first started. For me
            personally, I feel like I am lightyears ahead of where I was when I first started keeping this journal. One
            more positive about it, is that any potential employers could take a peak at it and see how much work I, or
            you, have put in to learning everything there is to know about web development or computer programming. So,
            enjoy reading my personal triumphs and failures. As well as a
            bunch of other events that have taken place during my life in this time-span.

        <h4>Welcome</h4>
        <p>I, Kenneth Olsen, WILL BECOME A FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER. I am going to complete the Odin Project.
            I will attempt to remember to log my daily progress in this journal. I decided to learn how to program
            about
            3 months ago. I started with Python and worked my way through quite a few tutorials and a couple books such
            as
            "Learn Python 3 the hard way" by Zed Shaw and "Automate the boring stuff" by Al Swiegart. I just kept
            getting
            stuck with certain aspects of it all. So, I decided to look at some other languages and settled on "Ruby".
            It was enough like Python that I felt I was picking it up easy, but different enough to feel fresh. Anyhow,
            Trying to learn Ruby is what got me to The Odin Project.
        </p>
        <h4>March 27, 2018</h4>
        <p>Started Odin Project. I have A windows machine and tried to set up the run Linux on windows option.
            WHAT A PAIN IN THE ASS!!
            I don't think I have it set up properly but time will tell.
        </p>
        <h4>March 28, 2018</h4>
        <p>Set up my Git account and started my first repository. Had some trouble, but i think iI figured it out.
            Also completed some of the reading of the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
            Starting the CodeAcademy intro to HTML. That should keep me busy for a while.
            Finished the CodeAcademy Intro to HTML in about an hour and a half. Not nearly as long as I thought
            it was going to be. What a pleasant surprise. Now to start on the CodeAcademy intro to CSS.
            Hopefully it goes as quick and smooth as HTML.
        </p>
        <h4>March 29, 2018</h4>
        <p> Returned to work after my 2 days off. I've also been doing every coding app for android I can get my hands
            on.
            A good app is called Sololearn. Ive completed the Python, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, Java, and one more
            language
            that I can’t think of at the moment. But, now I'm back home and working on the intro to CSS on CodeAcademy
            again.
            Just realized that I never actually finished the HTML on CodeAcademy. They started making me try to pay for
            the
            next portion yesterday, but today when I clicked it it let me start doing it again. NOW the CodeAcademy
            HTML section
            is done. Back to work on the CSS section. Finally finished the intro to CSS.
        </p>
        <h4>March 30, 2018</h4>
        <p>Just found out today that my grandmother doesn't have very long to live so I will not have the time to get
            in as
            much work as I have been. I am going to try to get an hour at least of practice in a night. Tonight, I
            start the
            HTML dog tutorial. Wow that was a lot quicker than I thought it would be. It was done in about a half hour.
            I
            actually, preferred that style of tutorial over the CodeAcademy one because you actually get to build the
            page.
            I think when I have some extra time I'm going to build a blog for this instead of just recording it for
            myself.
            Who knows, maybe if I'm successful with becoming a developer this journal could help out someone else that
            wants
            to change careers. Now to start on the HTML Dog CSS Beginner tutorial. Well I am having issues all of a
            sudden
            with getting my PC to load my files to the web-page, so I am going to have to come back to that tutorial.
            Got
            half way through the drawing the android bug tutorial, but I have to call it a night.
            P.S. I also did all my phone apps while at work. You can pretty much count on that every day.
        </p>
        <h4>March 31, 2018</h4>
        <p>Didn't actually get to work on The Odin Project at all today. I had work in during the day and then after
            work I went and spent time with my Grandmother who only has a few days left. While I was at work I did put
            in
            a couple hours of practice on my phone apps. I also researched some blog tutorials so I can turn this into
            a blog.
            Tomorrow I promise I'll be back at it though. I actually did get a tiny bit of work in. Not part of The
            Odin Project
            though. It’s a very cool website called Dash. Basically, another walk-through of HTML and CSS but a very
            good one.
            I would recommend it over CodeAcademy and HTML dog.
        </p>
        <h4>April 1st and 2nd, 2018</h4>
        <p>Was sick the last few days so I haven't gotten too much done. I did my apps while at work and briefly did
            some
            reading and watched a few videos about HTML and CSS but that's about it.
        </p>
        <h4>April 3, 2018</h4>
        <p>So, I have been doing a little research and I found a different course that I am going to do alongside the
            Odin Project.
            It is called FreeCodeCamp, and it seems to have a lot of success stories. I believe that the maker
            of The Odin Project actually got his start from there, but don't quote me on that. So, wish me luck!!!
            Finished all of the HTML and CSS stuff. Tomorrow I start on the jQuery.
        </p>
        <h4>April 4, 2018</h4>
        <p> Today was a lonnnnng day at work. One of the reasons it was long is because I'm starting to get the itch to
            just
            want to code all day. I like that. You can say you have a passion for this stuff all day, but once you get
            the itch
            and it’s all you want to do I feel like that is really when "passion" is an acceptable word. So, at work I
            did my usual
            apps. I keep trying to find new and better ones, but all the actual good ones you have to pay for, so I
            find myself
            going back over the topics I've already done. But, Oh Well. Once I got home I started on the FreeCodeCamp.
            I finished
            all the jQuery stuff and finished my first project, which was a tribute page for Winston Churchill. I think
            it went
            pretty well, but we will see what kind of peer feedback I get.
        </p>
        <h4>April 5, 2018</h4>
        <p>My Grandmother passed away today so I will not be getting much done while I get family stuff in order.
            I did however do my normal apps at work.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h4>April 6, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            I continued on the FreeCodeCamp. I am temporarily skipping over the portfolio project as I don't feel that
            I
            would be able to give it my full attention right now. I am on the JavaScript portion of the class right
            now. They
            kicked it up a gear and took off the training wheels for this. It is quite a bit harder but I am loving it.
            So, I have been reading some blogs about the best way to learn to be a full stack developer and one thing
            keeps popping
            up. It is a class on Udemy by Colt Steele called The Web Developer Bootcamp. I am going to give it a shot
            because
            quite a few reputable resources have recommended it. Plus, it is only 11 dollars right now!! You can’t beat
            that.

        </p>
        <h4>April 7, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            I am continuing on with The Web Developer Bootcamp. So far it is very informative, however I have already
            progressed well past what he is teaching at this point. It is still the beginning of it though and I know
            it will get
            to stuff that will help me out soon. Also, I think my girlfriend is starting to get mad at me with how much
            time I am
            spending doing all this. I keep telling her that it is for the good of both of us because I definitely plan
            on making a
            career out of this, but she doesn't understand. I do need to try to make more time to do stuff with her
            though. It is
            just so hard to stop doing this when everything starts to click and you get in the zone. I made it to
            section 3 which
            is intro to HTML lesson 24. Still stuff I already knew but definitely getting closer to the new stuff. I do
            however
            need to shut down for a while and go spend time with the old Ball And Chain. Hopefully I'll be able to get
            back to
            it in a little bit. I went back to work and got up to the first assignment of intermediate HTML which was
            making a
            pokemon data table. Finished it and looked beautiful. I am officially signing off for tonight though. Good
            night
            Kenneth...... Good night to you as well Kenneth.

        </p>
        <h4>April 8 to April 10, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            The last few days have been nuts for me. I can honestly say that the 10th was the first day in months that
            I
            did not sit down and try to get any work in. But with my Grandmother passing away and family coming in I
            really did not
            have the time. Plus, my sister and her fiancé have come in from England and they are staying in the
            basement where I do
            all my work. But I can’t complain. It is definitely nice to see them and I will just work extra hard after
            everything
            is done.

        </p>
        <h4>April 11, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            My sister is still in town but I kicked her out of the basement for a while so I could at least get in a
            couple of
            hours of work. She understands though. I have completed the HTML section on the Udemy class. I did have a
            bit of
            trouble with the form, but I believe that is because I left it half done a few days ago and when I went
            back I was a bit
            lost. But, I will catch back up. Now I am starting on the CSS sections of the class. I'll check back with
            my
            progress before I sign off for the night.

        </p>
        <h4>April 12, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Didn't have a chance to do much of anything today. Had a dentist appointment early and when I got home the
            family
            was sleeping in my computer room and they pretty much stayed there all day (sigh).

        </p>
        <h4>April 13, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Nothing really again today. Was another family day. Just got in a bit of research.
        </p>
        <h4>April 14, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            My sis and her fiancé went and stayed at my cousins’ house for the night, so I got up bright and early at
            5:30 am
            and completed CodeAcademys build your own website, deploy your own website, and learn responsive design
            courses until
            11:30 when they got back. Now I am about to be kicked out of their room / my computer room for a while.
            Took my laptop
            outside in the cold garage to try to get some done around 8:30. Ended up getting in the zone and staying
            out there till
            the battery was about to die at about 11:30 pm. I got about 20% of the way through CodeAcademy JavaScript
            lessons.

        </p>
        <h4>April 15, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            My sister and her fiancé leave today. I love them and will miss them but am definitely happy to get my
            computer
            room back. I also had to work today, but I brought my laptop because I was working by myself. I got about
            50% through
            CodeAcademy JavaScript lessons. Don't tell anyone I did that by the way. I am home now and my sisters
            flight got
            canceled so it looks like my computer room is going to be gone one more night unless my dad steps up and
            lets them stay
            there. Well I got to about 60% of the JavaScript done and now my sister and her fiance just showed back up.
            (sigh).
            Thanks Dad! So, I am going to have to sign off again. OH... I also got way worse news. My girlfriends’
            fuckin daughter
            is moving back here next week. This has been an absolutely awful day. I got my room back, at least for the
            moment. I
            have been doing pretty good on the JavaScript lessons until I got to getters and setters. I have to
            remember to go back
            and study that because I was getting pretty confused. But for now I have skipped ahead to classes. I'm done
            for the
            night. Its walking dead time (I don't know why I still watch it as it has gotten awful). I really need to
            go back
            through the last few JavaScript lessons.

        </p>
        <h4>April 16, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Just got home from work. While I was there I did my apps, however I am starting to run out of lessons on
            them so I
            have to figure out some new good ones soon. My sister left again this morning but her plane is stuck on the
            terminal so it is still to be determined if I actually get my room back. Something clicked and I am
            understanding
            getters and setters and inheritance in the JavaScript lessons. I dont know how that happens because last
            night I was
            completely stumped by it all but sitting down today I am getting it all. Don’t understand how it happens,
            but I love it
            when it does happen. Almost done with the JavaScript lessons but running into another roadblock with the
            modules, so
            I have to remember to go back and go over those again.

        </p>
        <h4>April 17, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Home from work. Didn't get much done there today because it was busy plus I can’t find any more good apps
            to learn from. Anyways I am starting back up on the CodeAcademy JavaScript lessons. I should finish them
            today. I DID
            IT!! Just finished the CodeAcademy lessons on JavaScript. Now I am going to start on either the jQuery
            lessons or the
            REACT lessons. Well I ended up doing the Angular JS lessons. These ones seem a bit buggier and not as well
            thought
            out but I am still understanding. I just finished the first portion of it now to section 2: Directives. Got
            through
            the directives part of the Angular lessons, but I have to sign off because my girlfriend is sick. So, I
            have to make
            food and all that good stuff.

        </p>
        <h4>April 18, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Just got home from work. Decided to just re do the JavaScript portion of the SoloLearn app. I really
            must be learning because I breezed through the entire lesson in about a half hour. When I originally did it
            I believe
            it took me a few days. So that's pretty cool. Now it’s time to start back on the Angular lessons on
            CodeAcademy. Just
            finished the Angular tutorial... it was not a very good one. Plus, I just realized that the tutorial was
            for version 1.x
            and the current version is 5.4 so it’s a bit dated. I think I am going to do the tutorial on React.js now.
            I actually
            really liked the React tutorial, but I have decided to put the brakes on that for now and learn more
            JavaScript
            instead of frameworks. I will come back to it though. So, I am going to read and do the exercises out of
            "You don't know
            JS" by Kyle Simpson. I will let you know how it goes. The book is for beginners of coding as well as
            JavaScript, so I
            am going to skip the first chapter as I feel I am already pretty well versed in the absolute basics of
            programming.
            Chapter 2 starts with actual JavaScript though. so off I go. Uhhhhhg I just spent the last like 2 hours
            trying to
            configure an IDE specifically for my JavaScript. I am trying out WebStorm by JetBrains. I liked PyCharm by
            them so
            I'm giving it a shot. But it was a pain in the ass to get everything set up the way I want it. But, it is
            all set
            up and I’m ready to go.

            Just got home from work. Because I am pretty much out of mobile phone apps instead of doing them on my
            free time I've been just researching and reading up on different things. But I am now going to check
            hackr.io for some
            good JavaScript tutorials. I am doing the javascript.info tutorial and have made it to the while loops. All
            the
            JavaScript tutorials are super boring, why can’t they have more like pythons’ tutorials? Those were all
            pretty good. Oh
            well. I am going to head back over to FreeCodeCamp and work through some more of their stuff because this
            one is going to bore
            me to death.

            Today was pretty much the first nice day of the year so instead of spending it in my computer room I
            decided to take
            a break for the day and enjoy the weather. So, I basically just did yard work. At night I did do some
            research on some
            other potential languages to learn. I liked the GO programming language as well as Elixir and Crystal. But
            GO is the
            only one that seems like it could potentially lead to a job as of now.

        </p>
        <h4>April 21, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Enrolled in yet another class. Udacity's intro to JavaScript. I really need to stop doing that and just
            focus on 1
            tutorial or course at a time. This one seems pretty good as well though. Other than doing that I have spent
            what feels
            like hours trying to get Webstorm to do automatic line breaks instead of just continuously scrolling to the
            side. I
            finally got it but there are still a few things wrong. But it’s acceptable for now.

        </p>
        <h4>April 22 and 23, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Did not really have the chance to do much the last couple days. I had a work situation of which really
            pissed me off and a root canal so wasn't feeling to great.
        </p>
        <h4>April 24, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Had to work all day... I am really starting to hate that place. All the more reason to get going on the
            coding. Today I didn't get much done as far as apps at work although I did try out C++ for a while and even
            though I just looked at the very very basic stuff it didn't seem as bad as people make it out to be. Since
            I've been home though I tried watching my Udemy class for a while but even though it was highly recommended
            it is just moving along too slow for me. So, I signed up for just one more. It's a purely JavaScript course
            by Travesty Media. The reviews made it sound like it might move along at a better pace and so far it seems
            pretty good.
        </p>
        <h4>April 25, 26, 27, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            I've been kind of slacking this week. I have not felt good on top of it being extremely stressful at work.
            Also, I am running out of tutorials that actually engage me. I did sign up for a pluralsite account and
            that class has been alright, but I think I learn better from a book with examples that I can work along
            with. I got to try finding a few good ones.
        </p>
        <h4>April 28, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Found a good book It's called JavaScript: From Novice to Ninja. It is exactly what I wanted. It sort of
            reminds me of Learn Python the Hard Way only for JavaScript. I've worked at it for about 3 hours today and
            have made it to page 130 on functions. I won’t be able to do much more of it today though because my
            girlfriend wants to watch some T.V. with me. (Sigh) I'm not a huge fan of television, but I'm a pretty big
            fan of my girlfriend so I better do it. Got to page 148 about variable hoisting. Signing off for the night.
        </p>
        <h4>April 29, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Just got home from work. HALF DAY TODAY!! I did get a little done at work, though all it was was resetting
            the python course on SoloLearn. Now I'm home and have restarted on the book. Have progressed through a few
            pages about callbacks in function, but I have to go cut the lawn now... Maybe one more page before I go do
            that. I got back to it for about another hour and got into the chapter about objects. I am getting sleepy
            though so I think it is time to log off for the night.
        </p>
        <h4>April 30, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Didn't get very much done today as I had to job search. I am not one to normally complain about my job like
            this because I know everyone does, but I am being royally screwed at this place!! I need to get out of
            there! I did get a little bit done though. Just some more stuff on objects and using functions with them. I
            have made it to the part about JSON. I promise I'll work double hard a couple days coming up
        </p>
        <h4>May 1, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            I just job searched all day. Will get back to it tomorrow.
        </p>
        <h4>May 2, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Finally got back to it today. But the very first thing I tried to do in the book took me like an hour and a
            half. I am covering JSON now and I could not get my example to run for anything. So I figured maybe
            PowerShell won’t let me do it and tried it in VSCode for about a half hour then I started thinking maybe I
            have to install JSON and spent about 20 minutes trying to figure that out. When I finally went back and
            went over my code again I found a FRIGGIN ERRANT DOUBLE QUOTE!! That's all the problem was. I could kick
            myself. But its all good and running know.
            REMINDER!!!!!!! READ UP ON REGEX!!!!!
            The book covers it a bit but from the looks of it I need some different stuff for it to work. The book
            actually recommends going to a few different websites. Finished that chapter. I guess that was the end of
            the basics. Now its saying that its time to start using it in the browser and the first chapter is about
            the DOM (Document Object Model). I shall start on that tomorrow, but it is late now and my girlfriend just
            got home from work so it is time to sign off.

        </p>
        <h4>May 3, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Haven't got much done today either. This has been a bad week for my learning. I am however working through
            the DOM chapter, but I have an awful headache and it is getting late so I probably won’t do a whole lot
            more.
            REMINDER!!!!!!!! LOOK UP MORE ABOUT THE DOM!!!!!

        </p>
        <h4>May 4, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            MAY THE FOURTH BE WITH YOU!! HAH happy Star Wars Day!
            I didn't get anything done today, but I do have some potentially very good news! I had a job interview
            today for doing maintenance at an apartment complex. The interview went very well. The property manager
            said if it was 100% up to him I would already have the job, but I have to go through 1 more interview on
            Monday with the maintenance director. I am sure I'll get the job if I want it though. Fun Fact about me.
            Literally only 1 time in my life have I gone on a job interview and not got the job, and that 1 time was
            because the boss was a legit retard and was getting confused with my resume. Anyways, the job pays about 4
            dollars more an hour than I am making now and it is also a management training program. Alllllsssssooooo I
            mentioned about my working on learning computer programming and such and the manager was thoroughly
            impressed. I suppose you don't see many maintenance men that are tech savvy, so that was pretty awesome.
            Anywho, after the interview I had to come home and do a bunch of yard work, so nothing got done today as
            far as educating myself. Overall it was still a good day though.

        <h4>May 5, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Woke up super early because the herniated disk in my neck was making the nerves in my arm hurt like a son
            of a bitch. So I just went straight to the computer room and started working. Finished chapter 6 which was
            introduction to the DOM and have started on chapter 7 which so far is about event handlers. The DOM was a
            very boring chapter but this one seems much more fun. I think I am actually starting to get close to the
            animating web pages part. I am going to get back to it though. I will check back in, in a little bit. I
            made it through chapter 7 which was event handlers. I think I need to go back and re check all my source
            code though because my quiz dojo does not look like the books. I am leaving off at chapter 8 which is about
            forms. It is a beautiful day out so I am gonna go walk the dog and get some other stuff done, but I shall
            be back later. Today was a pretty exhausting day, but when the weather finally changes in Michigan then
            Damnit you go outside and enjoy it while you can. I'm back to it for a little bit now. Still in the forms
            chapter. I made it about half way through chapter 8. I am on page 304 now. I'm chuggin right along with
            this book. It is however time to relax and watch a movie with my girl. Will be back tomorrow.
        </p>
        <h4>May 6, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Just got home from work. Was a half day today, but I know that I am going to get called in. I really hate
            that place. I am starting back in on the Novice to Ninja book, starting back on the forms section. Just
            finished chapter 8 about forms, but in the ninja quiz project I messed something up. So, I have to go back
            through and see what happened. I'm going to save that for later though. Time to start on chapter 9 which is
            about The Window Object. SOUNDS EXCITING!!!
            I was being sarcastic when I wrote SOUNDS EXCITING!!!, but it actually was one of the better chapters. I
            animated my first thing online! It was just a spinning red square but still had me pretty excited. I am all
            the way to the Ninja Quiz portion of the chapter which is always at the end. My girlfriend is getting mad
            at me though for being on here too long. I really wish she would sit down and learn some of this with me. I
            really do think she would enjoy at least the CSS part of it, but she refuses to even look at it. So, I have
            to sign off for a while. Probably be back in a little bit though to at least finish the chapter.

        <p>
            Sorry I haven't recorded what I have been doin the last few days. I have been doing some work on
            everything, it’s just been so sporadic that I haven't had a chance to record anything. But on the 7, 8, 9th
            of May I basically just was trying to debug the code from the Novice to Ninja book. Wellll nothing I did
            would work, so I managed to track down the source code for the project on GitHub. I went as far as to copy
            and paste the code directly, so there is just something wrong with the code. It ended up turning me off to
            the whole book. If he has errors like that in his own source code I just wonder how reliable the rest of
            the book is at teaching me. So I went back to finishing the tutorials on General Assembly. Well, I have
            moved past those tutorials on my own. They were very boring and I already understood it all. General
            Assembly was still a great resource for beginning to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but like I said I had
            already moved past what they were teaching. So for the last few days up until May 12 I had just been trying
            to find other resources to learn from while getting in some practice just kind of on my own every day.
        </p>
        <h4>May 12, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            I am going back to square one. The first JavaScript book recommended and the first one I had started
            "Eloquent JavaScript". When I was first starting it seemed much too hard for me, even though it is for
            beginners. But, now that I have some other practice under my belt, going back and looking at it now I feel
            I can grasp it much better. So that is what I am going to be doing. As an aside I just want to say that I
            have recently been going on the website Quora where you can ask questions about anything to professionals.
            Some people are assholes and really don't want to help and just want to put you down for trying to learn,
            but others are very informative, understanding of a newbie, kind, and most importantly willing to help. So,
            I am going to head their advice, FINISH THE WHOLE BOOK!!!!
            AFTER THE BOOK IS DONE START WORKING ON MY OWN PROJECTS!!!!!
            Sorry for the all caps but I want to make sure that when I come back I see that and listen to it. That is
            the only way I am truly going to learn it is by putting it to use. So off I go to continue "Eloquent
            JavaScript". I made it about halfway through chapter 2 today. Stopping just after learning about the arrow
            function, which I have already learned a number of other times, but practice makes perfect!! Reminder for
            tomorrow I AM AT RECURSION.

            Happy Mother’s Day!!!!! I hope all the mothers have a great day today, even though this message won’t get
            to them because this journal is only on my computer for now!! LOL. I probably won’t get a lot done today
            but I am going to sit down and try to get some done now. NOTE TO SELF: GO BACK AND DO CHAPTER 2
            EXERCISES!!!! Well I decided to try making my simple blog out of this here journal... I felt like I wanted
            to cry. It feels like I haven't learned anything. I am going pretty much back to square one and gonna read
            an entire HTML and CSS book then back to Eloquent JavaScript, because I don't really know what else to
            do...

            Well I didn't let yesterday’s slump get to me. I really just decided to go back to the basics. So I am
            going through the book HTML5 for Dummies. It is about 100 pages but it is advertised as 8 books in one and
            goes over HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, as well as some other stuff. So back to basics it is. I am about
            halfway done with the first section of the book covering just HTML5 at this point.
        </p>
        <h4>May 15, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Got home from work at about 5 and had to do some stuff for a woodworking project I am working on. Around
            7:30 got going on the book. Learned a bunch of stuff I already knew, but I think I needed that. Nothing was
            sticking when I tried to work on the project the other day. But I did learn some new stuff, basically just
            some different input types for HTML5 though. I finished the first section on HTML5 and am now moving on to
            CSS3. This is where I feel I really needed some practice. I made it to page 156 about @font-face. Seems
            like a good place to stop for the night. See You Tomorrow Kenneth.
        </p>
        <h4>May 16, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Didn't get a whole lot done today. I did however get past the main JavaScript part of free code camp. So, I
            get to move on to Object Oriented Programming with JavaScript. HOW EXCITING!!!
        </p>
        <h4>May 17, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Just got home from work, twas another exhausting day. I had my fifth interview with the same place today
            though, so it sounds like I will have a new job soon. Anyways, I finished up the OOP JavaScript section on
            FreeCodeCamp. Now I am at the algorithm challenges which are quite a bit harder. I am taking a break from
            that though and gonna go through some more of the book. I did a little of the book, but I started the
            Upwork tutorial again too. I usually don't like video tutorials, but this one seems better than even the
            Udemy classes that I actually paid for. I gotta log off for a while though because its supposed to rain for
            a few days and I gotta get my lawn cut before that. So, I will be back later. I am back and I finally
            learnt one thing that I have been waiting to learn, and that's how to make stuff go to the other side of a
            web-page. To clarify it is just putting some <div></div>'s in and in your CSS file instructing it to FLOAT:
            RIGHT; or left or whatever, but I am happy to finally get that piece of information. I made it about
            halfway through the CSS portion of UPSKILL's Essential Web Development course. I know I say this a lot but
            this is a good one. Seriously this is the best one I have done yet, and ITS TOTALLY FREE!!! Now I sound
            like an advertisement for them, but it is good. There is still a whoooooole lot left of it though. After
            the CSS portion I build a blog, of course walked through by them, and then there is the entire back end
            section with Ruby on Rails, and then a walk-through of building a fully operational website. Tonight
            however, I am done. So, Goodnight.

            I missed a day somewhere in here, just to let you know. Anyway, I am home from work. It felt like a super
            friggin long day. I am starting on the Upskill tutorial. I got through a bunch more of the CSS stuff and
            finished that section. Now I am moving on to the first project which is something that I have wanted to do
            for a long time. I AM FINALLY GOING TO TURN THIS INTO A BLOG!!! I got through the first part and set up an
            account with AWS (Amazon Web Services.) This section we are using Ruby on Rails too. I never knew how
            quickly ROR can make thing happen. I already have a few of the blog posts up but I am going to wait till
            tomorrow when I have more time to add more. But still, HOW EXCITING!!

            This is my one day off a week. I don't know why, but I just can’t sleep in anymore. Used to be on my days
            off I could sleep till noon. Now, I'm lucky if I sleep in past when my alarm would normally go off for
            work. Oh Well, just gives me more time to study and practice my skills. I am back on UpSkill's Web
            Developer course. As I said before, this is definitely my favorite one that I have ever done. I pretty much
            already have a fully functional blog that I plan on uploading alllllllllll this journal too in a little
            bit. Which I am extremely excited for, for some reason. I think I may be excited because when I post
            questions on sites like Quora.com and explain that I do practice every day I just am having trouble with a
            certain concept and things like that, always, without fail there is someone that tries to jump down my
            throat trying to tell me and everyone else that looks at the question that "There is no way you can
            practice for 2 hours every night. If you work a full-time job and have a family, as you say, then you must
            be lying to us.". Well No, I am not lying to you all. I do practice for a few hours every day. I am lucky
            enough to have a girlfriend that understands what I am trying to do, and since I actually enjoy doing this,
            I can get lost in the time and not realize that "Oh crap, I have been down here for 6 hours doing this. I
            gotta stop and go to bed.". Now that I am going to have this blog, I can shut up some of them, of course
            there will still be some that will accuse me of lying in the blog, but oh well, you can't please everyone.
            I am still extremely excited to get it all up and running though. So off I go to continue working on it.

        <h4>May 21, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Just got home from work. I am still pumped from yesterday. I haven't felt that good about trying to learn
            all this for a long time. I know it was just converting VS Code to run the way I wanted it to and finally
            understanding how to use GitHub but those 2 things (especially the GitHub) actually made me pretty proud of
            myself. I am glad I had a little victory like that after just last week feeling pretty down on myself about
            feeling like I'm not getting anywhere. BUT, it is time to start back on the Upskill course. I shall check
            back in later. I am going much slower in the course now, but it is because I have to figure out how to do
            everything the way he is in the course. Which means I have to convert everything he is doing from the
            virtual cloud machine of Cloud 9 to VS Code which isn't that bad, but what is hard is trying to go back in
            time and figure out how to install all the Ruby Gems from 4 years ago because this course was made in 2015.
            I am loving it though, it is definitely giving me the opportunity to troubleshoot for myself. I just spent
            a nice long time on stack overflow trying to figure it all out, but you know what I THINK I GOT IT! Well I
            just wanted to check in and write that all before I forgot too. I am off to do some more of the course. So
            yes, just in case you were wondering, I did get it all figured out. I have to say that I am pretty proud of
            myself. I didn't get a whole lot more done though. Just adding a home page with 1 headline on it so far.
            Now that everything is set up properly though, I should be able to start cruising through the course again.
            Once again, I cannot stress how much I love this course. I definitely know I am actually learning instead
            of just copying or something. It's late though, so off to bed I go. Goodnight.

        <h4>May 22 and 23, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            So when I got home from work yesterday Windows 10 was ready to install there big spring update, now I have
            not had very good luck with these in the past. It seems like every one of their big updates somehow break
            my computer and force me to spend a whole day trying to figure out how to fix it. GUESS WHAT!!!???
            Yesterday was no exception. I started the process at about 6 o clock in the evening and by the time I was
            ready for bed it was still only at like 23% so I just said screw it and let it go over night. Well, this
            morning when I woke it was only at 60%, so I did a little research on my old laptop and saw that there were
            plenty of people having the same issue. So I took everything into my own hands and have figured out
            somethings, but I am still working at it. It is 1:40 pm now and I started trying to fix everything at 9:30
            am. I am making some progress but this really pisses me off. This is basically a brand-new computer, I just
            got it about 3 months ago. Microsoft, I love you. I have always been a windows guy, but you guys need to
            get your shit together and stop breaking computers with your updates. I will check in again in a little
            bit. Hopefully this will be fixed and I can do some work. Oh, one more thing, I also woke up super friggin
            sick this morning. So, the last thing I wanted to do is deal with all your crap Microsoft. Well it is
            3:45pm and it is still not fixed. I had to go through about 20 different steps but I think it at least is
            going to get fixed. It better because my brand-new laptop is taking forever to load anything and lagging
            really bad. If this doesn't get fixed I am swearing off Microsoft for good. It's 7pm and it is still not
            totally fixed, but like I said I am pretty sure I figured out how to make everything work. I have been
            running a different program trying to make it straighten out the Windows Spring Update and reinstall it.
            So, while it is still super laggy, I am going to try to get some of the course in. Ohhhhh, I don't think I
            mentioned it but I am sick as hell today. So, dealing with the stupid update and being sick has made it a
            pretty miserable day so far. It is almost 8pm. My computer works but is still being slow and laggy, but the
            update says it is 96% done. I am feeling very very BLAHHHH, but I did get in a little of the course. I
            added Twitter's Bootstrap to the website and a few other little tweaks. I have to get up and move aroun a
            little bit or something though. So, I am going to get up and take the dogs on a quick hike around the block
            and shower. Hopefully when I am done my computer will be good to go and I can continue learning without
            being aggravated by having to watch every change I make happen on the computer 2 minutes later. It is 10 pm
            the computer is finally done but now everything is still running super slow. I SWEAR IF I EVER SEE BILL
            GATES WALKIN AROUND IM GONNA KICK HIM STRAIGHT IN THE NUTS!!! Hopefully the slowness of it all is just
            stuff getting used to the big new update beacuse if it stays this bad I am gonna be pissed. Anyways, I
            obviously did not get too much done today. I will get back to work tomorrow though.
        </p>
        <h4>May 24, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            So, the computer is finally fixed... I think. I had to delete 2 separate anti viruses though. Funny enough
            the only one that lets my computer work is plain old Windows defender. Coupling that with Malwarebytes
            ought to do though. Other than that, I ran late for a drug test for my potential new employer and the place
            friggin closed. I got there at 7 on the dot and they were all walking out. So, know I gotta drive way far
            away to another one and hope that everyone will understand. Something just always seems to happen to me. I
            got to run and do that though. Hopefully it doesn't take long and I can get at least a little bit of the
            UpSkill course in today.
        </p>
        <h4>May 25, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            So I went and got my drug test and all that taken care of last night. Hopefully I will have a new job in a
            few weeks. But, when I got home my computer was laggy and slow again, so I ran some tests. It said my fast
            video memory, or something like that, was failing. I contacted HP tech support since I have 9 months left
            on the warranty. I had to stay up with this dude, who had control of my computer, till almost 1 am. He was
            getting kind of creepy at the end. I kept saying "OK, Dinesh thank you very much I got to go to bed now
            though", but he would not get the hell off my computer. Eventually I just uninstalled all his LogMeIn
            stuff, but the way he was makes me a little scared he put in a back door or something to get into my
            computer. Not like I have anything to hide or anything, but still. Whatever he did appears to have worked
            though since my computer is passing all the tests now. So that’s good. Home from work. You will never guess
            who emailed me twice while I was there... That's right Dinesh. The creepy customer service person. He wants
            to call me again at like 630 to finish up my computer. Well I didn't have to deal with Dinesh again, but I
            did have to deal with 2 other ones. Neither of them knew how to do anything. I would have rather had creepy
            Dinesh back. Anyhow, they got into my computer then looked around and seriously I can't stress this enough,
            DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!! So, for about 2 hours they did that, then one of them finally tells me that they
            are going to have to send me to tier level 2 customer service people, which I also would have to pay for,
            even though my computer is under warranty still. So, I simply thanked them for their time and said no and
            made sure to tell them that I will try to figure it out on my own. They tried to argue with me, but I just
            cut them off and uninstalled them from my system. GUESS WHAT!!?? After about an hour I had my system
            running better than ever. I am still angry though because I had planned on getting some serious work in
            tonight. I haven't really gone this long without doing anything since my sister and her fiance were in
            town. Oh Well Though, It is fixed, so at least I know that starting, hopefully, tomorrow I will be able to
            get back to work on not only a fixed computer, but a better one. I forgot to mention I did a bunch of
            optimizations as well, because I am awesome like that. But I gotta sign off now. I will see you in the A.M.
        </p>
        <h4>May 26, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Just woke up. I hate getting old. I cannot sleep in no matter how hard I try anymore. But, as I said before
            that at least gives me time to get some work done before everyone else wakes up. So, for the first time in
            some time I get to start on the UpSkill course. I have a bad feeling though that when I get in there and
            start goin that something else from that stupid update is going to have broken something I need, and I will
            probably spend another day setting everything back up. Well, let us go see if that is going to be the case.
            Off I go. I'll check back in a little bit.
            I called that. I just spent the last hour having to re set up all my gems for ruby. I think I got it though
            so I am off to give it another try. Well so far so good. I went through a whole section of the UpSkill
            course, starting the server worked, git worked, it saved all my progress, so everything seems to be in
            order. I just have a feeling that something is going to sneak up and F*%k me when I least expect it to.
            I've done about 6 more lectures and no issues so THAT'S AWESOME!! I know this isn't very humble of me, but
            sometimes I really impress myself. All those tech support guys didn't help at all, actually besides the
            first one, they actually hurt everything. Then I decide to take over and BOOM! I have the computer running
            better than new. Anyways, as I said I made it through about 6 lectures, mostly covering design. I decided
            to veer off from the coursework a little bit. He has everyone making a site called DevMatch, which matches
            developers to entrepreneurs, but I have always had this idea for a maintenance service that works
            specifically with rehabilitation patients and their physical therapists. Basically, someone goes to therapy
            and then their therapist calls me at "Rehab Renovations"(This may not be the actual title, but its not bad)
            and we go to their house and put up grab bars, raised toilets, walk-in showers, and anything else that they
            would need to give them quality of life in their own home. I have never seen a business like this and it
            fits right into my skill set. So, I have veered off of his coursework, and while I am still doing the same
            things, I am making my business website instead of his. I have to get off of here and go do some yard work
            though. I shall be back later though. I am back. Did the lawn and then went and got some flowers and stuff
            for the yard. It was miserable. There were a billion people at the place we went and its 90 degrees and
            muggy. I am glad to be home. Now to get back to work for a little bit. I am back. I thought I was going to
            have to go to the hospital. I was sweating so bad and it was getting late so I just pushed through and by
            the time I only had a few lines left to cut I couldn't even focus. I am alive though. I made it. I came
            back to work for a little bit and pretty much added an entire business page and about page to the website I
            am building with the help of UpSkill. As I said, I definitely veered off from the project he has us doing,
            but mine is turning out pretty nice. As far as a business goes, I think this one is a great idea too. I
            really think I could make money with the idea. By the way, I am sorry this blog has kind of turned into a
            journal of my life and not just about my journey to becoming a web developer, but I have found that it is a
            pretty good stress reliever to come down here and get some stuff off my chest. I hope you, Dear Reader,
            don't mind .... "Crickets".... HaHa there are no readers beside me!! Well eventually hopefully there will
            be some readers, because it is still fully my intention to turn this into a blog. It is time for me to sign
            off though, SO GOODNIGHT TO ALL MY READERS AND FANS ACROSS THE GLOBE!!! HAHA I crack myself up.

        <p>
            I just got home from work. I am going to tell you something that I tell other people all the time but I
            don't think they believe me. I would prefer -20 degrees and a foot of snow every day over 90 degrees and
            humid. IT IS SOOOO FRIGGIN HOT OUT! I have probably lost like 5 gallons of water from my body in the last 2
            days. I am not supposed to be in this weather. I have Viking ancestry. All Danish and Swedish, give me cold
            weather all day, but please not this crap. Anyways I am going to relax for just a few minutes and then get
            down to business on the UpSkill course. I'll check back in a little bit. I just finished the first half of
            the UpSkill course, which was pretty much just the front-end stuff. Now we get to start on the back end. I
            am going to go eat some lunch, but I will be back in a little bit. So, after I ate lunch I went outside and
            did some yard work for a little bit and then came back and got going on the back-end stuff. I made it
            through about 4 more lessons which was a lot of learning bootstrap for making forms. I am just crazy tired
            today. I know it's because of the heat, but normally no matter how shitty I feel or how shitty of a mood I
            am in, I love coming down here and working on all this. For some reason today is a struggle though. I am
            pushing through that and getting stuff done still. I just don't like the feeling of not having fun right
            now. I am gonna take a break for a little while, maybe for the night, so I can come back refreshed and
            roaring to go tomorrow.
            HOLY CRAP!! It has been 3 months since I started making this journal / blog. I had started trying to learn
            Python prior to doing this, but as far as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, and a bunch of other stuff goes this
            marks 3 months. So, I would like to take some time and reflect on what I have learned in this time.

            1. I can tell you my typing has gottin 1000000% better. I typed with my 2 index fingers when I started. Now
            I am not quite good enough to not look at the keyboard all the time when I am typing, but I probably will
            be able too soon. Also, I am a much much much faster typer than when I started and make a lot less
            mistakes.

            2. I could not have told you a single thing about HTML when I first started. Now, I can confidently say
            that I am very capable with HTML. It is one of the few things that I feel extremely comfortable with at
            this point. I know it is probably the easiest of the front-end languages (actually probably the easiest of
            all the languages), but it still a nice accomplishment for me considering I started from absolute ground
            zero.

            3. I know enough about basic syntax and structure with the main languages that, as long as it’s not
            something crazy and way different, I feel that I could pick up the absolute basics of a lot of languages
            rather quickly.

            4. I can make my projects look the way they are supposed to look with proper control flow.

            5. I know enough CSS that, along with HTML, I feel I could make some pretty good static sites.

            6. I probably know enough terminology to be able to at least understand most of a conversation with an
            experienced programmer. Don't get me wrong, I would still sound like a total noob, but at least we would
            understand each other for the most part.

            7. I can ask a question the proper way on stack overflow.

            8. GITHUB!! It took me until very recently, but I finally understand it and have gotten a few repositories
            going. I was crazy excited when I finally learned this one, because I thought I would never understand how
            to make GitHub work.

            9. I know much of the vanilla JavaScript. Not as well as the HTML and CSS, but I am working at it.

            10. I at least have a grasp of Ruby on Rails, but I still have to do alot more work with it to understand
            it better.

            11. Even though I have a Windows computer, I use the Linux Ubuntu Bash shell and have a pretty good
            understanding of it now.

            12. I had never really used Windows PowerShell prior to starting all this and I am very competent with it
            now.

            I know there is a CRAP-TON more stuff that I have learned, but that is the basic gist of it. I feel like I
            have come a long way since I first started, and I know I am still far off from turning this into a career,
            but I am still pretty proud of myself for what I have done so far and I am not stopping learning everything
            anytime soon. As I said in the very first line of this journal I AM KENNETH OLSEN AND I WILL BECOME A WEB
            DEVELOPER!! Ha did you notice I took the full-stack part off? It is because the more I have read the more I
            realized that full-stack is kind of a myth. Every web developer is pretty much full-stack in one way or
            another from what I understand.

            Happy Memorial Day!! I unfortunately had to work today but am home now. Actually, I shouldn't say
            unfortunately I make double time and a half on holidays, but the best part of working holidays isssss.... I
            get to leave while my girlfriends family comes over! I know that's not very nice of me, but some of them
            really really bug me. The really unfortunate part of everything though is that they are still here.
            Anyways, because of this unfortunate event, I probably will not get in as much work as I would like. I am
            still going to get some in though, while I have the chance, so off I go. I just did another big
            accomplishment for myself!! Completely on my own I added an "Our Services" page to the website including
            setting up all the routes, controllers, nav-bar links, everything!! I know that doesn't seem like much, but
            I did it without any hand holding or anything. I did mess up once and thought I wrecked everything, but I
            did some research and figured out how to fix it with GitHub. I fixed it and created a new one all on my own
            though. That is exciting for me! It really lets me know I am progressing. After I am done with that website
            I am definitely coming back to making this a blog. For really the first time since I started all this, this
            last week has made me think that I really just might be able to turn this into a career. A CAREER I WILL
            LOVE ON TOP OF THAT!! I never wanted to be a maintenance man and thinking that I might actually be able to
            dig myself out of that field makes me extremely happy. It is late and time for bed though. I will see you
            tomorrow.

            Just got home from work. It was another long miserably hot day. This weather just makes me feel so crappy
            and crabby, and on top of that my cold or whatever it was feels like it's making a comeback. I am going to
            relax for a few and get to work on my UpSkill course. I got through a couple lessons. Creating a database,
            which is something I have not experienced at all yet, so that's cool. I got stuck for like 45 minutes
            though. All it was, was a friggin end tag I forgot to put in to!! I hate that, but at least it seems that
            every time I get stuck it seems to be something simple like a syntax error, but it sure is aggravating! I
            am going to take a break for a bit and go outside and water all the flowers and stuff but I will be back in
            a little bit.

        <h4>May 30, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Got home from work a couple hours ago. I feel like garbage today. I got some news at work too that just
            sort of leads to more stress even though most would look at it as good news. So, as I have said in earlier
            posts, I am about to be getting a new job. Well my boss offered me more money to stay today, but it's not
            in writing yet, which I am going to demand, and it is only 50 cents more than the other place is offering.
            The thing is that normally I would probably still take the other job as I could potentially advance there
            and where I am at now I am not going to advance and I know that. However, if I take that other job I feel
            like I am resigning to the fact that I am a maintenance man, which I don't want to be. If I stay I can make
            a little more money and really stay focused on my work trying to learn development. I want to bet on myself
            and just stay, but if I don't succeed than I may have blown an opportunity. I passed on an opportunity to
            take a maintenance supervisor job about 6 months ago too and I don't think my girlfriend would like me
            passing another one. I wish there was a way to know if this is going to be a path that I should keep
            taking, because other than me and kind of my dad I don't really think anyone believes I can self-teach
            myself this stuff and actually turn it into a career. Anyways, even though I feel awful today I am going to
            try to get some work in. Welp... All I got done was a little research. Just kind of going over a little
            documentation for Bootstrap and GitHub. Uhg. Hopefully I feel better tomorrow and can jam out a few lessons
            and maybe work a little bit on my extra stuff for the website. I got to go to bed and try to get better
            though. Goodnight.

        <h4>May 31, 2018 and June 1, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Just got home from work. I didn't do anything yesterday. I didn't sleep a wink the night before, and
            really, I didn't last night either. I am feeling pretty awful and delirious right now, but I am gonna push
            through and get some stuff done today. I have to take some time and figure out how to rearrange my and my
            girl's room because we are getting like no air conditioning in there and it has been SUPER HUMID for the
            last few nights. For now though I am going to get some stuff done. I started actually creating a brand-new
            blog from ruby on rails and on VS code. I did everything with very little help including linking it to
            GitHub, getting bootstrap, re setting up ruby on rails because the other tutorial had me using old versions
            of everything, so I set it up with all the new stuff. I did a bunch more too. I know if this was any other
            day I would be jumping around excited but seeing as though I have barely slept and feel like crap I don't
            really have any emotions lol. I definitely got stuff done though.

            Just woke up. I managed to sleep last night, but I still woke up early as hell. You would think with home
            tired I am I would be able to sleep in, but noooo. Oh well though, I’m off to go do some work on my
            projects. So, I messed around and broke my blog. That is ok though because I redid almost the entire thing
            and I am making it way better. I restarted and added an about page and a contact page with the database and
            everything already. Now I just have to put in the actual blog portion of it. But, I have to go do some yard
            work for now. I am back. Taking a break from the yard because I really still don't feel very good.
            FreeCodeCamp has updated and has a crap-ton of new content, so I have gone through and refinished all the
            HTML and CSS portions of it and started on a different visual part that I can't remember what it's called,
            but that is pretty awesome. Now when I start to get a little bored with the UpSkill course or building my
            blog I can do the FreeCodeCamp stuff again. Oh, I forgot to mention, my girlfriend through a big old hissy
            fit this morning because I was smoking in the basement (Yes, I know it's a bad habit). SHE AGREED TO IT
            THOUGH!! AND NEVER HAD AN ISSUE UNTIL HER FUCKING DAUGHTER CAME HOME FROM COLLEGE!! I know that's the real
            reason she throws the hissy fit's, because her daughter says she can smell it. WELL YOU KNOW WHAT!?? I get
            one day off a week. Saturday is the only day I can get up early and come down stairs and really knock some
            stuff out with all this. If I am forced to go outside than that will totally disrupt my flow, so I am
            laying down a RESOUNDING "I don't care!", I am smoking in the basement, in the morning, for my one day off
            a week! I know it's awful, but her daughter is supposed to be going to Florida for 2 months coming up
            really soon, and I CAN"T WAIT! LOL. Enough of me being an asshole. But, I am going to continue doing what
            we both agreed on months ago. Sorry to vent like that. I got to go back out and finish the yard work
            though, so I'll be back in a little. RIGHT AFTER I FINISH MY SMOKE! HAHA! The lessons in FreeCodeCamp that
            are new are Applied Visual Design. It's actually some pretty handy stuff. I just got totally done with the
            yard and came inside and did a few of the lessons, but now it's time to go take a shower and get something
            to eat. I'm sure I'll be back yet again though. I got back to work and added all the content to the about
            page on my new blog web-site. Also, added a bunch of CSS and some more bootstrap and google fonts stuff. I
            gotta say, all those people on Quora were right, building stuff instead of just going through tutorials is
            for sure helping me learn way quicker. So Kudos to you Quora people. It's about time I started building
            stuff though. After I am done with the blog I am going to start working on a portfolio page so I can put my
            work online. I need to start looking up prices for web-site hosting and domain names and stuff too. I got
            to try to think of some domain names actually. Hmmmm, K-O.com, KennethOlsen.com, webdevjourney.com,
            thecodingjourney.com? It's got to be something catchy that people will remember. How about K-Ocoding.com or
            coding-K-O.com. I think I like coding-K-O.com. It's my initials plus coding as the first word, so that way
            people that search for "coding" on google or whatever are more likely to see it. I got to remember to see
            if that is available. I got to go to bed though, because it's back to work for me in the morning.
            Goodnight.

        <h4>June 3, 2018</h4>
        <p>
            Just got home from work. It was another exhausting day. Let me tell you, we have a resident at my work (I'm
            the maintenance man at a nursing home that specializes in Alzheimer’s and Dementia, in case I haven’t
            mentioned it before.) that probably once a week he starts pissing in PTACs (A PTAC is a hotel style air
            conditioning / heater unit.). I don't know why he does it, but it is really getting on my nerves. Those are
            heavy and not very easy to change. He did it today and as I was changing it out, alllllllll his piss flew
            out all over my shoes!! UHG! Please anybody that reads this, give me a job in web development. I am eager
            to learn and I promise you it will not be a mistake. I can't handle getting pissy shoes anymore. Anyways, I
            got a new app for my phone to kind of work on at work, but I have definitely moved past everything that it
            is teaching, but going over it all again can't hurt, so I worked on that at work. Now, I am going to start
            back up on the FreeCodeCamp for a little bit and then do some work on my blog or the UpSkill course. I'll
            check back in, in a little bit. I did about 10 more of the FreeCodeCamp CSS lessons, then I had to run back
            to work to sharpen my lawnmower blade and oil it, and then of course put it back together. When I was at
            work sharpening it I must not have been paying attention well enough and accidentally slipped my finger
            into the grinding wheel. Thank god I caught it quick, or that would have been the end of my being able to
            type, but it just grazed me. It still hurt though. Then I had to water all the flowers. I swear, I am
            constantly busy. I suppose that's good though, because as they say "Idle hands are the work of the Devil".
            I am done with everything though. I am just going to take a break for a minute and then shower and then
            hopefully my girl will let me come back down and practice for a while. Off I go, I'll be back in a little.
            I got done with everything and came back downstairs. I told my girl that I would only be down here for a
            short bit and then I'll come up and watch a movie. Wellll, I accidentally stayed down here for almost 3
            hours. OOOPS. I got back on the UpSkill course and instead of doing his project, I am going to try to apply
            the stuff he is teaching to my Blog/Journal website. I figure I will actually learn alot more that way
            because not everything he is teaching translates super well to what I am doing. For instance, I spent about
            an hour trying to fix something that he taught that would have been fine on his project, but on mine it
            made this little white strip in between the 2 Bootstrap containers we put in. I had to look up and change
            like 4 things in my HTML and CSS, so I definitely am going to learn more this way and probably retain it
            much better. Oh, and last night when I was looking up domain names and prices and hosting prices I found
            out that codingko.com, coding-k-o.com, kocoding.com, and k-o-coding.com are all available and so are all
            the other domain suffixes like.net, .us, and all the other ones. As far as hosting goes, GoDaddy.com offers
            their basic package with a free domain name (for one year) for only 12$ dollars a year, and after the first
            year the price would go up to 24$ dollars a year because I would have to pay for the domain name. Still,
            that's not a bad deal, actually it's the best one I have found. So I'll probably go ahead and do that once
            this is a little closer to being deployable. I gotta go to bed though. Goodnight.
        </p>

            Well, I did it again. I normally would wake up for work at 6:50AM. I have today off work and woke up at
            6:20AM (sigh). I don't know why this is. I am super tired, but there is no chance of going back to sleep.
            Oh Well. I decided to be nice this morning. Since it doesn't feel too bad outside I grabbed my laptop and
            came outside to sit on the deck and smoke. Plus, this way I don't start off my day getting bitched at.
            Anyways, I already completed some more of the FreeCodeCamp stuff this morning, but I think now I am going
            to work on applying some more of the UpSkill course to my Blog/Journal web-site. So, I am going to go do
            that and I'll check back in, in a little bit. I am working on my blog through the UpSkill course. I just
            wanted to check back in really quick to remind myself to! REMINDER! GO BACK AND RESEARCH FLASH UPSKILL
            LESSON #65! Ok, that's it, back to work. I went outside to water the grass and flowers, and let me tell you
            first, I am OBSESSED with making sure I have the best-looking yard in the neighborhood. All the old guys in
            the neighborhood try to keep up, but no matter what I always have the best-looking yard. Number 2, I don't
            know how my dog craps sp much. I just cleaned up the crap yesterday and there is at least 6 new poops out
            there. It's friggin amazing! Anyways, back to work on the UpSkill course. Oh! I had another idea. I am
            going to put all of my projects together in 1 website. The Homepage for my blog/journal is going to be my
            professional portfolio, and on another page, I will put the blog. I may put only that day’s blog post on
            the homepage too. I figure that, that way either thing will get a lot more views. People that come for the
            blog will also see my portfolio if they want to hire me, and likewise, people that came to see my portfolio
            will be able to see the blog, so they can see how much work I put in every day. Sounds good to me at least!
            I also have to create some social media accounts on Facebook, twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and any other
            ones that I can’t think of right now. Now, I have always been a strong advocate against social media. I
            think it depresses people, and I dont need everyone to see what I ate for dinner every day. With doing all
            this though, I kind of need them. I do think all the social media is good for business, but not so much to
            socialize. I actually am pretty proud that I haven't had a social media presence in like 10 years. All good
            things must come to an end though, so I better get on doing that too. Awesome!! I just finished kind of the
            back-end development section of the UpSkill course. So, I deployed my sight through Heroku and everything.
            Obviously, there is still a lot of work to do before I can actually make it public, but still, PRETTY
            SWEET! The last part of the UpSkill course doesn't really concern what I am doing (although I will be going
            back and finishing it for the other web-site project I was doing), so now the rest of everything I need to
            do for my blog is all on me. Really, all I have to do is figure out how to add a blog page into an existing
            web-site, fix up the home/Portfolio page, and then just some CSS style stuff. SWEET! I forgot to check back
            in all day, so I will try to remember everything I did. I know that I went outside and did more yard work.
            Other than that, I styled my web-site a bit more. I think I came up with my logo. It will be (NOTE: Cant
            display the avtual logo here.) CODINGKO.com I think that looks pretty alright. I didn't realize I hadn't
            checked in since after the other BIG thing I got accomplished today, I finally got my entire blog page up
            and running on the web-site! So, know all I have to do is style it all, make some more content, add these
            blog posts in, and I am sure a butt load of other stuff that will take me months, but hey, at least I am
            really learning and building something on my own, and not far from deploying it. I think that this is
            really going to help me eventually get hired by someone. After a few more projects that I can put on the
            Portfolio page of the web-site. Then, whoever my potential employer might be will be able to see some
            projects and see all the work I put in everyday on the Blog part of the web-site. I really feel like I am
            making a whole, whole lot of progress in the last few weeks. I don't feel like I am very employable yet,
            but I feel like I am not as far off as I would have thought I would have been at, at this point. Plus, if
            any potential employers read this, then maybe they would recognize that with some better structure to my
            learning, I could be a decent developer in pretty short order. A potentially great developer after a bit
            more of an extended time frame and the right teacher. "Wink, Wink" <<<< I'm looking at you potential
                employer, who is reading this right now. Why don't you shoot on over to the contact page and leave me a
                message about becoming your employee! HAH. In all seriousness, whoever you are that eventually hires
                me, I can and will promise you that it will not be a mistake. I gotta go to bed though. I accidentally
                just did that thing again, where I am just doing stuff, and in the zone. Thinking that I have only been
                down here for an hour, but really, it's been 3 hours. I know I did it because my girlfriend came down
                and informed me again. So, Goodnight to everyone that will be able to read this soon, but can't yet! </p>
                <h4>June 5, 2018</h4>
                <p>
                    Just got home from work. I decided to day that I am going to bet on myself. I am staying at the job
                    I currently have instead of taking that other supervisor position. The pay wasn't that much better
                    and if I took it I know I would not have had much time at all to practice and learn all my
                    development and programming stuff, so I am betting on myself getting good enough doing this to at
                    least be able to do some freelance work. Ideally, I would be able to get a real job doing this, but
                    even if I can just make enough side cash I'll be able to justify my decision to my girlfriend and
                    family, because they are not going to be very happy. Anyways, I remembered another page I want to
                    add to my website. It's the tutorials page. I want to be able to help anyone that may come to my
                    website sift through the thousands of tutorials online and cut right to the good ones, because let
                    me tell you, there are A LOT of tutorials online, and A LOT of them are not very good. So, if I can
                    help someone else figure it all out then great. After all, that is why I decided to try to get into
                    this field, is to try to help people. Oh, and just some side news, my girlfriend is being dumb. I
                    can't stand it when she (or anyone for that matter) does this. "I have some kind of shitty news,
                    I'll tell you about it later". YOU KNOW WHAT!!?? MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST WAIT TO EVEN SAY "I have bad
                    news" TILL LATER!!!! THAT WAY I'M NOT SITTING HERE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY WORRYING ABOUT WHAT IT
                    IS! Another thing she did, right in the same sentence is "Oh and Corinne (Corinne is her daughter)
                    made it safe to Florida, thanks for asking". I have been AT WORK ALL DAY. Sorry it was busy and I
                    couldn't spend my day chatting with you. I guess I would just assume if something bad did happen
                    YOU WOULD FRIGGIN TELL ME ABOUT IT!!! Sorry about the venting, I just get really aggravated with
                    the way some people communicate. That is pretty much why I don't really communicate with people. I
                    am a quiet person, but only because I don't like small meaningless talk. If I am talking it is
                    because I have something to say that is either interesting, or important. I don't like talking just
                    for the sake of talking. GEEEEZE. It's time to get to work though. I'll check back in, in a little
                    bit.

                    Hey! Look at that. I'm on my phone at work right now. I just got my Google drive on my phone going,
                    so now I can make notes and stuff in my developer journal whenever I want! Awesome! I wanted to do
                    this because I am constantly thinking of stuff at work that I want to remember when I get home, and
                    without fail, I always forget. I want to remember to add another page to my website for tutorials
                    that helped me, because it's tough sifting through all the tutorials online. There is just so many
                    of them, and so many are not of very good quality, or are advertised as "for beginners" when
                    actually it's just the first chapter is for beginners and then it jumps into advanced stuff way to
                    quick. Well, I just want to lay out some of the ones that worked best for me (being a total
                    beginner all the way up to now, which I would probably call intermediate). If coming to my web-site
                    can help out other people, then that would be great. After all, that is what really got me started
                    on my journey, is being able to, or at least trying to, help people. Lunch is almost over though.
                    So, I'll check back in later, probably not till I get home, unless I think of something I have to
                    remember. So I'll talk to you later.

                    Ha I figured out how to use google drive on my phone at work earlier and wrote that, and then
                    forgot I wrote it, and just now remembered I wrote it. So, I figured I would share it even though I
                    basically already wrote the same thing above it. YOUR WELCOME. I didn't get as much done today as I
                    wanted too, but I did some styling and adding navbars and indentations, and a few other things. My
                    girlfriend wants to hang out for a bit now though. OH! Did I mention what her bad news that was
                    going to ruin my day was!!?? It was simply that she is going to have to work an hour later on
                    Tuesdays. That's it. That's all it was. HAHA. Anyways, I better go hang out, so I'll catch y'all on
                    the flip side. Do people still say that? I don’t know. Goodnight.

                    Just got home from work. I spent a lot of the day at work trying to think of some ideas or looking
                    around for inspiration for the landing page of the web-site. I also am going to try to pick up the
                    habit of carrying a little notebook and pen with me for when inspiration strikes. I jotted down
                    some pretty decent ideas today, so I have a pretty good idea of what I want my homepage to look
                    like. Other than that, it was just a pretty normal busy day. Time to get to work though. So I spent
                    allllllll day doing 2 friggin things and neither of them worked. One of them actually broke the
                    website, so I had to spend a bit of time figuring that out and then just used GitHub to take it
                    back to yesterday. All day, and nothing accomplished. I guess though, if you want to spin a
                    positive on it, I learned a whole bunch of what not to do. Some people might even say that knowing
                    how not to mess everything up is an important skill, I suppose. Even so, I need to have another
                    good day like I was having for the last few weeks. I did make some deadlines for to get things done
                    to try to push myself. I don't have all the details in front of me, but I know my final deadline is
                    July 1st. I am crazy tired and it's late though. So I 'll be back tomorrow.

                    Home from work. I stayed pretty friggin busy there, but I did start doing some research on CSS
                    selectors while I was there and writing it all in my little notebook. Also, I have a buddy at work
                    that is a super talented artist. He has actually drawn for DC comics before. Well, I'm trying to
                    get him to take a cue from me and follow his dream and what he is good at. So, I'm going to build
                    him a website next so he can showcase his work and such, and he is going to illustrate some stuff
                    for me for my web-site. Sounds like a pretty good trade to me. Actually, I wouldn't mind going into
                    business with him, if I can talk him into learning how to do CSS down the road, because he is as
                    talented an artist as I have ever seen. He has got that creative mind, so putting him in charge of
                    CSS could be do wonders for him and I. It's time to get to work on my stuff though. Check back in a
                    little bit. I almost had as bad a day as yesterday. I had to reset everything from GitHub once and
                    then almost another time, but I fixed the problems. Both were Gems for older versions of rails. But
                    then, I figured out how to style the
                    <% yield %> tags in CSS, so that made it a somewhat more bearable day. IDEA>>> It might be stupid
                    or obvious to some other people that read this, but I'm thinking of putting up some actual
                    tutorials for total noobs. Little things like how to style the yield tag. I bet it would help quite
                    a few beginners actually. But!! My girlfriend is yelling at me. So got to go.

                    Got home from work about a half hour ago. Today was pretty exhausting. It was a painting day,
                    allllll day. I started going through the Ruby on Rails documentation while at work and writing down
                    important things to remember in my little notebook, and I looked up some Web Development companies
                    around Detroit to try to see what kind of technologies they use, so I can know where to focus after
                    I am done with my web-site. One company in particular sounded amazing, and from the looks of it is
                    the kind of company I would love to work for WHEN I finally break into the industry. They are
                    Platinum Innovations. They look like what you see in the movies. Like the type of place that would
                    encourage you to bring in your skateboard and board around the office instead of walking. Well, I
                    found them very intriguing, so I emailed them. I just told them a little about me and asked if they
                    might have time to let me visit their office and ask a few questions and stuff. I am really not
                    expecting to hear anything back, but it would be pretty friggin awesome if they did. I could
                    possibly leverage a visit with them into a job down the road. I told them that I would like to just
                    ask them a few questions about what technologies they think I should try to learn, and what the
                    best way to go about learning them may be and stuff. I tried something similar to this awhile back,
                    but then I was asking if they would teach me in exchange for maintenance work around their office.
                    I think that may have been coming on too hard, so I am hoping just asking to visit goes over a bit
                    better. It would be awesome if they responded. Anyways, it is time to get to work on my project.
                    I'll check back in, in a little bit. Ok, I need to learn how to use GitHub a little better. This is
                    the third day in a row that I have messed something up and needed to go back to my last commit, but
                    I end up having to download my entire repository and then set everything up with a new repository.
                    It's just a pain in the butt and I know there is a way to go back to it, it's just I can't figure
                    it out and all the answers on Stack Overflow and stuff never seem to work. Anyway, I got my project
                    back and then managed to add some authentication and pagination to my admin panel and my posts
                    page. It's good that I am learning more of the back-end stuff, but I really need to get on styling
                    everything, because the site still looks like garbage. After I get all this crap figured out
                    though, which I am close to I think, the I can really focus on that. I am about to go walk the dogs
                    with my girlfriend though. I might be able to get a little more done tonight, but I am not sure
                    because it's pretty late. I'll try though. If not then goodnight. Got back, did a couple
                    FreeCodeCamp lessons, Getting Yelled at Right now. Got to GO.

                    I am just now sitting down to write what I did today and it's already 10:30pm. I did get quite a
                    bit done though, it's just because I was being rushed to go do other stuff, so I kept having to
                    hurry up and quit what I was doing and never ot a chance to write it down. I kind of want to get
                    rid of bootstrap on my website. It makes it so hard for me to style anything. I spent probably 2
                    hours just trying to get the header right before I finally said "Screw It” and got rid of the
                    bootstrap container. I did get my color palette down though. I'm pretty sure I am going to stick
                    with a sort of dark blue background and then bright orange writing. It still looks super amateur
                    though, but I think I need to focus on just getting it deployed. I think I will feel better once
                    it's finally online. Other than that, I looked up some stuff about CSS animations because I have
                    this cool idea where my "KO" logo is going to be hiding behind some mountains, and then peek out
                    and run up to the screen. If I can figure it out I think it'll be pretty awesome. I got stopped in
                    the middle of everything to go to a wedding, which was insanely boring. When I got home I got to do
                    a little more, but now my girl is acting sad. So, I need to go hang out with her for a while. I
                    actually need to start going up there with her more often, but I just get stuck down here doing
                    stuff and just don't realize the time. I am going to go now though, but I'll be back in the
                    morning. Goodnight.

                    Well it's a rainy Sunday here in Detroit. I had plans to go out and do yard work today, but oh
                    well, doesn't look like that is going to happen. I woke up super early again. No matter what, I can
                    never sleep in past 8am anymore. I am truly envious of my girlfriend and everyone else, that on
                    their days off, can sleep in till like noon. So, I quietly got up at like 7:30 and grabbed my old
                    laptop and went out to the garage (So my cigarette smoke didn't piss her off) and did some
                    FreeCodeCamp. I completed 2 of the sections, I think they were Applied Visual Design, and CSS
                    Flexbox, I almost finished CSS Grid to. When my girl finally got up I got to come back inside. So,
                    here I am, back downstairs, on a rainy Sunday, so all I really have to do today is work on my
                    development stuff. SOUNDS GOOD TO ME! I'll check back in later. It is now 10pm. I have been waiting
                    for a day like today. Everything started to flow again and I made a whole, whole lot of program on
                    the web page. I also had a lot more time to work on it today to though. That's why I need to just
                    get a job doing this. It takes a minute to get the juices flowing, but once they are, they flow
                    good. I got a picture of me finally up there, and a few other ones. I fixed a whoel lot of layout
                    stuff and styled a bunch more stuff. It is actually starting to look really good. I still have a
                    lot of work to do though, but I have been waiting for a day like today for like 2 weeks. I am
                    definitely starting to understand how to get the layout going the way I want it to by using
                    Position: relative and then setting the top, bottom, left, and right. I even started learning how
                    to manipulate photos today, that was pretty fun. I also talked to my sister today, and she also
                    thinks, like her fiance, that I might be wasting my time. He is a WordPress guy, so he thinks that
                    all websites should be built with that. Well, I guess, yeah. If you want every website online to
                    look the same with nothing custom, no custom animations, and just bland static pages like we are in
                    the mid-nineties. That's why it aggravates me to talk to her sometimes though, because she
                    definitely thinks she knows everything, because she is the social media manager for Barclays bank
                    in England. I will admit that getting a high paying job doing this is not going to be as easy as it
                    was in the early two-thousands, but I don't need a 100,000$ a year job. If I even make 60,000$
                    it'll be worth it to be doing something I love to do. I gotta go shower and chill out with the old
                    ball-n-chain though, so I may be back in a little bit, but if I am not, the Goodnight.

                    Today was a lonnnng Monday. Not that it was crazy busy or anything, I just did not feel like moving
                    today. While I was at work I did a bunch of research and wrote it in my little notebook. Mostly
                    about CSS animations. I have some pretty cool ideas of things I want to animate for the website,
                    but I know there is no way I would have them done in time for my deadline, but I can add them after
                    the fact. I am going to get to work though, so I'll check in, in a little bit. Uhg. I swear I had
                    good intentions to get stuff done today, then I had to go do a bunch of crap, then my girl needed
                    help with a bunch of crap, then just everything seemed to break. All I really got done is adding a
                    gem called will paginate to my web-site that displays only a certain number of posts per page. I
                    guess it's better than nothing though. It's late though, so I am going to bed. Will be back
                    tomorrow.

                    Just got home from work. Another long day. I was thinking at work about maybe adding a page for
                    some other relevant information for programmers. Where I could maybe put the headline from their
                    news and a picture and load it onto my sight, so that people that want news can just one stop shop
                    at my site. I need to look up the legalities of that though. I am going to get to work though. So,
                    I just spent literally the entire day just trying to solve one problem again. Whoever designs some
                    of this stuff needs to get punched in the dick. All I wanted to do is make it so that the table
                    that my blog posts get loaded to doesn't expand along with the content. It seems like I see it in
                    other places all the time. Well, as far as I can tell in neither HTML or CSS do they allow you to
                    fix the cell height. You can set the width, but that is not what I wanted. I searched everywhere
                    looking for a solution and there were plenty of people asking the question, but no real answers.
                    That is, until I found it. One random person on some obscure site answered the question and the
                    solution seems simple, but it is not. You basically have to override the table settings by making a
                    style tag in the HTML and then setting the width, overflow, text-overflow and a couple other things
                    I'll have to add in here later<<<<<<<<<<<<< REMEMBER TO ADD IN!!!! Geeze though, now I have a
                        headache from staring at the same problem for so long, but I am happy as a pig in shit to have
                        finally gotten it. Actually, I have been working on that problem for more than just today, it's
                        just normally I give up and move on to something else. I was determined today though. I WAS
                        GOING TO SOLVE THAT STUPID PROBLEM, and I did. I would have never figured it out had I not
                        decided that I was going to sit here till I did. It is late and I gotta shower and get ready
                        for bed though. At least I got that accomplished today though, but watch, that will end up
                        messing something else up. I am not going to even look and see tonight because it will just
                        piss me off if that's the case. I am giving it a break for the rest of the night though. So,
                        Goodnight. </p> <h4>June 13, 2018</h4>

                            Got home from work about an hour ago and was just looking around at some CSS generators I
                            found while I was at work. It seems like some pretty cool stuff, but I am not going to use
                            any of them yet. I did some more note taking in my little notebook while at work too. It’s
                            filling up fast. I am going to have to get some more notebooks soon. Also, something else
                            happened while I was at work that pissed me off. For the last 9 months we have been missing
                            1/3 of our department (and for 2 months of that time it was literally just me at work).
                            Well, my anniversary at work is coming up in a week and I have almost 80 hours of unused
                            vacation time that I literally could not take, and it's supposed to be that if you don't
                            use it, then you lose it lol. Well, under the circumstances that I was in, I think it would
                            only be right of them to pay me out that vacation time... DON'T YOU?? I mean, there was no
                            way in hell I could have taken it. So, I am contacting our corporate office in Tennessee to
                            see if they can help me out, because that just isn't fair. I know company policy and
                            everything but given the circumstances they should break the rules on this one. Anyways, it
                            is time to get to work. I'm back! So, I had an easy day, but a productive day. I added a
                            bunch more tutorials to the site and started working on the layout for the tutorials page.
                            That page actually still has a lot to go, because as I said I want to add my own tutorials
                            for some of the easier stuff so that beginners have someplace to go to learn the noobish
                            stuff. codingko.com is really shaping up to be a good site. I'm not just tootin my own horn
                            either. It's the type of site that I have gone to plenty of times plus it has the extra
                            minor tutorials. I really need to get on researching SEO though. Maybe I will do that
                            tomorrow at work. I hope that the site is pretty successful and that I can land a paying
                            gig because of it. I got to go hang out with my girl for a little bit though. So, I'll be
                            back tomorrow. Goodnight.

                            Got home from work about 2 hours ago, but I just wasn't feeling getting right to work today
                            as I normally do. I'm just tired today. I did get some good news today though. That
                            vacation issue I was dealing with got resolved and they are going to pay me out for it.
                            Also, that company I was telling you about last week that I tried to get in contact with,
                            get back in contact with me. I asked them on Twitter if I they would consider hiring
                            someone with no experience and they said "Sure depending on the role". Well, like I said, I
                            don't really think I am job ready yet, but I followed up with a question asking if they
                            might let me visit their office and ask some questions. I haven't gotten a response yet,
                            but (especially because it's on twitter where everyone can see it) I have a good feeling
                            that I will at the least get another response from them. Even if the response is to say no,
                            that might make me a bit more memorable for when I am ready. I am going to try to get some
                            work in now though, but I am not expecting much out of myself today because of the whole
                            tired thing, and I don't want to force myself and start disliking this or something. Off I
                            GOOO! I actually got quite a bit more done than I expected to. Basically, just adding a
                            bunch more content to the tutorials page though, so it was easy stuff that didn't require
                            to much brain power. I did come up with a pretty cool idea for a different navigation menu.
                            A light bulb with 5 thinking bubbles coming off of it and when someone hovers over one of
                            the menu items the bulb turns on. I am sure it's been done before, but still it's a pretty
                            cool idea I think. Even though it's only 9:15 I think I am done for the night though. Like
                            I said, I have been pretty sleepy all day. I'll get back to it tomorrow though. Oh, Fingers
                            crossed about hearing back from that company that they will let me come visit. Anyways,

                                    It is actually already the 16th of June as I am writing this. I have been busy all
                                    day and haven't had a chance to write down anything. I had to do allll the yard
                                    work today before the big storms we are supposed to get tomorrow. All I really got
                                    done today is adding some more content to the tutorials page anyway. I ran into a
                                    few problems though, and neither one is resolved yet. First I tried to use the will
                                    paginate gem to paginate my tutorials page, but that wouldn't work. I believe that
                                    somehow is what caused my second problem and that's that for whatever reason my
                                    localhost:3000 will not let me connect to it. I think that when I tried to paginate
                                    my page that it got stuck in some sort of loop, and even after restarting my
                                    computer it wouldn't let me on. So, I switched the port and it's working fine, but
                                    it was still very frustrating. I am tired though and it's already 12:30AM. I'm an
                                    old man now so staying up past 10PM makes me feel tired lol. Anyways if it ends up
                                    storming and raining all day like it's supposed too I am sure I'll get a bunch more
                                    done tomorrow. Off to bed I go though. Goodnight.

                                    It's Saturday and I have the day off. I still woke up early as shit though. So, for
                                    the last couple hours I have been sitting outside messing around with photo editing
                                    software like AdobeCC and GIMP. I wish my girlfriend would learn how to do at least
                                    this stuff. I think she would really enjoy it and it would give me more time to
                                    work on the actual website stuff, but she always says "I don't have the time to do
                                    it." Well, I call BS on that. I heard a quote one time that I loved and that is
                                    "Never say you don't have the time to do something, because you have the same
                                    amount of time as Einstein, Gandhi, and Edison." That quote is so true too. I
                                    basically live by that quote. It makes sense. If you want to do great things than
                                    you just have to use your time wisely. You will rarely find me sitting around doing
                                    nothing, because I know how valuable my time is. So, I try to spend every bit of my
                                    time trying to either better myself or accomplish something else. Whether it be
                                    pulling weeds out in the yard, learning something more about programming or web
                                    development, or working on my website. I ended up getting pretty busy the rest of
                                    the day. Had to help clean out my gramma's storage unit, then went to my mom’s for
                                    a little bit, then had to get some work around the house done. I did finally end up
                                    getting these pictures cropped the way I want them for the website and added a
                                    bunch more content to the tutorials part of me website.

                                    Happy Father’s Day!!! Just got up, early as hell of course, so I have grabbed my
                                    computer and headed outside to get a bit of work in before I end up getting busy in
                                    a little bit with Father’s Day stuff. HOLY BALLS IT'S HOT OUT TODAY!!! On the
                                    bright side though, I just bought my girlfriend a pool yesterday and it is about
                                    ready to go. So, when I get home from my dad's house I think I will be taking a dip
                                    in there. Anyways, for the last little while I have been working on my site. I
                                    added the "Tools" page which only comes off of my tutorials page and added a button
                                    (Which was a bigger pain in the ass than it probably should have been) to both the
                                    tutorials page and the tools page. I also finally got those pictures cropped the
                                    way I want them for the new navigation menu I am going to build. The site is
                                    Definity moving along. I hope I can make the deadline I made for myself. Speaking
                                    of the deadline, my girlfriend wanted to argue with me that it's a fake deadline so
                                    it doesn't matter if I reach it, so I have to take more time off to do stuff with
                                    her. Which I do agree with, but after this deadline, because I feel that especially
                                    for my first few big projects like this, I need to buckle down and not slack off. I
                                    really need to make my deadline just to prove to myself that I can and to actually
                                    get this accomplished. She will understand, I hope. Anyways, I got to get off of
                                    here for a little bit and get ready to head over to my dad's house, but I'll be
                                    back later. Back from my dad's. He is going to give me his old apple desktop. Now,
                                    I have always been a Windows guy, but it might be good to learn a little bit about
                                    macs. It's a bit old, I think from around 2006, but still. I am going to try to get
                                    a bit more work in though before my girlfriend gets home and makes me do stuff.

                                    I apologize for not having wrote in this journal at all this week. It's not because
                                    I wasn't doing any work on my project or anything though. Quite the contrary. It is
                                    because I was doing too much work on my project that I haven't written at all.
                                    Every day I have gotten involved so much in some part I was trying to get finished
                                    that I would lose track of time and end up getting yelled at. So, I shall try to
                                    briefly summarize some of the stuff I have done the last few days. I have gotten
                                    heavily involved with Photoshop and trying to edit certain pictures to look the way
                                    I want them too. I have learned a lot about it too, unfortunately, I believe that
                                    the Photoshop I have is only a trial version. So, I might get forced to go buy it.
                                    I hate the way they have you buy things nowadays though. You don't just purchase a
                                    product anymore. Now you purchase a subscription to the product and have to pay
                                    like 50 dollars a month for it. Anyways, I am almost done with my custom navigation
                                    menu. It is going to be all my links in these bubbles and when you hover over a
                                    link, a fist pops out at your screen with the link written on the fist like it's a
                                    tattoo. When you click on the link the first flies out at your screen and another
                                    picture of a broken screen pops up before taking you to the portion of the site you
                                    want to go to. I think it will be pretty friggin cool. I also started making a list
                                    of different subjects for me to actually give tutorials on. Things like how to pick
                                    your first language and the difference between object-oriented and functional
                                    programming. Like I said, I want this to be a site that beginners can go to to
                                    learn without fear of looking stupid. Today I actually started on a different
                                    project, that I might do before finishing my site. I am going to make a kitchen
                                    dashboard that displays the weather, traffic, and local news. It will also have a
                                    calendar and a few other little widgets. That is something that I have wanted to do
                                    for a while, I just never got around to doing it. So, I found most of the API's
                                    that I will need and I already have the Raspberry Pi, so really, I could probably
                                    get that done in a couple hours. SOOO, that is what I am going to go work on now.
                                    I'll be back in a little bit, unless I get yelled at again. Then I will be back
                                    tomorrow morning since I do not have work tomorrow. WOOT! WOOT!

                                    Welp. I got yelled a last night, so I couldn't finish writing down everything I
                                    did, which, wasn't a whole lot. I spent the rest of the night just trying to get my
                                    computer to connect to my Raspberry Pi, but I just could not figure it out. I got
                                    it to connect this morning, but only in root mode, which I do not want. So now I am
                                    completely starting over, all the way to the point of reinstalling the Raspbian OS
                                    on the Raspberry Pi. It's all starting to aggravate me. It should not be this hard
                                    to get this up and going. To be honest with you, as far as the dashboard project
                                    goes, if it keeps giving me issues for even just an hour longer, I am probably
                                    going to stop messing with it and put that project on the shelf for a later date.
                                    The OS is almost installed, so I am going to go try to figure that out. I'll check
                                    in, in a little bit.
                                </p>

                                    I never got a chance to check back in last night. Once again though it was because
                                    I was too busy with my projects and forgot to. I had to go to my girlfriends’ son's
                                    birthday last night. When I got home though I got a bunch done with the dashboard I
                                    am building (which isstill going to take me longer, but at least there was plenty
                                    of progress and learning). Then last night while I was waiting for some packages to
                                    download on my Raspberry Pi, I started writing my first, sort of, opinion piece for
                                    my website. I decided for my first piece to write "Understanding the Matrix. Don't
                                    be Intimidated by it as a Beginner” and I have to say, that for a rough draft, it
                                    sounds pretty good. I don't know if I have mentioned this before, but I have always
                                    had a gift for writing. You probably can't tell through this journal, but that's
                                    because this is more of a jotting down ideas or things to remember journal. It is
                                    just sort of my quick thoughts. When I actually sit down to write a full piece it
                                    usually turns out very well. Enough of tooting my own horn though. It is my late
                                    day at work, so I had an opportunity to come down here and write a little bit, BUT,
                                    it is time to get ready for work. So, I will check back in later when I get home,
                                    and also, I think I will be writing out a few more of my articles while at work. I
                                    will create a new page for them when I get home and start adding them to the site
                                    soon. So, I'll talk to you later. Just got home from work. I hate these late
                                    Fridays, they are so stupid. Nothing ever happens after 4 o clock so I have no idea
                                    why they make us work till 6 on Fridays. Anyways, I got a lot more done on the
                                    article I am writing, which is going to be the first article on my website. It
                                    might be done actually, and I think it turned out pretty danged good. I am off to
                                    try to get some work done at my dashboard though. I really want to hurry up and get
                                    that done.

                                    Today is probably the most miserable day I have had in a long time, and it is only
                                    going to get worse. First of all, my computer, which is brand new, broke. So, I
                                    have to reset it and lose everything from it. Next its 110 degrees outside, and
                                    that's not Arizona dry heat, that's Michigan, you might as well be swimming because
                                    of how high the humidity is, heat. It's absolutely miserable. My girlfriend doesn't
                                    care about that though. She is making me go on this stupid "Detroit Princess"
                                    cruise with her friends (who I do not like). Not only that, but I have social
                                    anxiety disorder, it is pretty well known that I do too. She is going to make me go
                                    on a boat (No escaping or walking away on a boat) with her friends (that I don't
                                    like to begin with). Not a single one of them understands social anxiety, so when I
                                    try to get away because I feel like I am going to die, they try to follow because
                                    they think something is wrong. No matter how many times I say "No, I am fine, I
                                    just need a breather", they feel like that is an invitation to sit down with me.
                                    This type of shit ruins my entire weekend. The computer being broke is definitely
                                    the icing on the cake though. Good thing I have saved this journal too Google
                                    Drive. It isn't current, so I lost about a week of things I have done, but that's
                                    manageable. Thank god I also have my website saved on GitHub or this would have
                                    been way worse. I really cannot stress enough how bad of a mood I am in. Anyways,
                                    I'll check back in later if everything is fixed and if I am not overly stressed to
                                    the point of just completely shutting down.

                                    So yesterday went just as bad as I thought it would. I’m not going to get into it
                                    to much here, but it was friggin awful. I got my computer reset and almost all the
                                    way back set up though, so that’s good. I might even be able to get in a little
                                    work today. I am just waiting on some things to finish installing and should be
                                    good to go. I’ll try to check in later if I get everything going finally though.

                                    Sorry I haven’t been keeping up with my journal again. It has just been stressful
                                    around here and the heat is totally kickin my butt. It has been around 100 degrees
                                    and super humid every single day. It is totally miserable. I finally got my
                                    computer fixed though, and I have been doing a lot of work on the website. It is
                                    really close to being ready, I just have to make a few more tweaks. I say that now,
                                    but I know I’ll end up working on it for like another 2 weeks. I hate coming back
                                    to this journal after I don’t record anything for a few days. I have done a crap
                                    ton but I don’t want to sit here and write it all out. So, I am not. Lol. I will
                                    get back to recording everything tomorrow for you though. I am off to go do a few
                                    things to the website and then to water all the stuff outside.

                                    Home from work and off for the weekend! So hopefully I get a bunch of stuff done
                                    with the site. HAH! I doubt that will happen. My girl already is trying to make
                                    plans for me for the weekend, plus, I kind of feel like crap. I’ll do my best to
                                    get as much done as I can though. I thought of something I want to do for the site
                                    too. All it is, is taking the long list of tutorials and tools and making it so it
                                    only shows 2 or 3 per page and then add in pictures and stuff. I am going to go get
                                    to work now though.

                                    I apologize again for not keeping up with my journal. As I have said, I have been
                                    so into trying to get the website done that, that is really all I do when I get
                                    home from work. Well, I don’t have work today because I have to go to my
                                    step-mothers moms funeral. So, I am going to try to get some stuff done before
                                    that. I have been losing my mind trying to come up with a color scheme for my
                                    website. Every color scheme I pick always seems to look very amateurish to me. I
                                    know I am still an amateur, but I want it to look professional obviously. I have
                                    switched my color scheme around from black and orange, to black and white, to white
                                    orange and green and everything in between and I just can’t seem to land on a good
                                    looking one. It is really, really bugging me. So, I think today I am going to
                                    focus, not on the color scheme, but on finishing a bit more of the layout. I have
                                    been wasting way too much time messing with colors, when I just need to finish it
                                    and worry about that last. So, off I go to go do that. I would say I’ll check back
                                    in later, but lately I have been forgetting to. Once again, I apologize, but it is
                                    because I am working so hard on the website.

                                    I FREAKING DID IT AGAIN!!!! I’m sorry. You know I love you. LOL. I have just been
                                    really busy on the website. Everything is starting to just flow though now, and I
                                    love it. I finally have learnt enough to not have to constantly be looking
                                    everything up online. Actually, I have been able to do that for a while, it’s just
                                    that I still always did. I just wanted to make sure that I didn’t break anything or
                                    something like that. Now though, I don’t have to worry about it so much. I have
                                    just been flowing and for the most part everything has been working. Let me think
                                    on what I did for the last few days here. I finally picked a color palette and
                                    stuck with it. It’s a pretty simple one, but it looks good. It is just a
                                    greyish-white background and charcoal black color for the lettering. For accent
                                    colors I have a darkish-blue that is the main one, then a whitesh-grey, and finally
                                    a gold type color. It looks good and I am just happy that I finally picked a good
                                    one so I can stop worrying about it. I also have been going back through my code
                                    and trying to get rid of any pixel measurements (which my entire code was measured
                                    in) and changing it to percentages, so my site would be responsive. Then I loaded
                                    all my images for the tutorials pages in (there was 72 images I think), then I
                                    figured out that I should have compressed them all. So, I had to go back through
                                    every single one and compress them. I also shortened the URL for all of them. Oh,
                                    and while I was changing the measurements I pretty much had to redesign everything
                                    because there is not a real guide on how to convert the pixels into percentages.
                                    What else? Oh, I changed the fonts up so I didn’t have 100 fonts for just 1
                                    website. Now I think I have 5 or 6 total. I also found a great image hosting site
                                    named Cloudinary. That site has a lot of great features. Much better then Google
                                    Photos. I even went out and bought Adobe Photoshop, but an older version (I think
                                    it is C6), that doesn’t make you pay for a subscription fee. OOPS! I got to go. I
                                    forgot I was supposed to go pick up my girlfriend about 20 minutes ago. I should be
                                    back though. I’m back, she wasn’t that mad. Only because she was drunk though lol.
                                    Something else that has been being discussed the last few days is a business that I
                                    have had an idea about for a while. I think I wrote about it in here awhile ago
                                    actually. I had already started creating the website for it before I started on my
                                    own personal website. It is the Rehab Renovations idea though. Basically, what it
                                    is, is that I would work directly with physical therapists. They would go into a
                                    house and survey it for any work that would have to be done for an individual to be
                                    able to stay at home instead of going to a nursing home or something like that.
                                    After the therapist goes in they would let me know what must be done. Then I would
                                    go in and install anything they need such as grab bars, walk in showers, wheelchair
                                    ramps, wheelchair van lifts, and any other ramps or things like that. I need to
                                    look into it but they may actually be able to charge their insurance company since
                                    I would be working directly with the therapists. I don’t think it is a
                                    million-dollar idea, but I think it could be a live comfortably idea. My girlfriend
                                    works for a doctor’s office and she brought the idea up to him the other day. He
                                    and the nurse practitioner both said that they have never heard of anything like
                                    that before and that it is a great idea, and that they would definitely use me. If
                                    I could get the therapy department at my current work to also sign on to the idea,
                                    then that would be enough clientele to get started already. Obviously though, I
                                    still need to do a WHOLE, WHOLE lot of work to get that idea off the ground if I am
                                    going to do it. According to almost everyone I have talked to about it though, it
                                    is a danged good idea. I already have a couple of people that I currently work with
                                    interested in working with me if I do start it too. In order for myself to get that
                                    started though, I would have to put this stuff on hold, and I really don’t want to
                                    do that. I really love doing this stuff and I think I could make just as much money
                                    doing this if I keep going at it the way I have been for the past half a year. I
                                    would also need to secure funding if I were to do that idea, and my credit is
                                    pretty awful so there is really no chance of getting a loan. I would have to try to
                                    do something like a GoFundMe page and see what I could get. I would need some
                                    pretty major insurance I would imagine, I would need all the equipment like grab
                                    bars and screws/ anchors and a bunch of other crap. Not to mention I would really
                                    have to take a leap of faith and quit my job to do it, which would be pretty scary
                                    for a brand-new type of business. I think that no matter what I am going to look in
                                    to it though and see what the costs might be to get started. I wouldn’t have to
                                    advertise or anything because, as I said, I would have contracts with physical
                                    therapy establishments and not with the customers, so there would be no need for
                                    it. I don’t know. I hate getting my hopes up about stuff, only to get close and
                                    find out there is some major hurdle that I can’t jump. So, all the work that I had
                                    put in would be for nothing. That is really the number one thing I wanted to do
                                    even with learning coding and programming though, is to help people. That would
                                    definitely be helping people. It would absolutely feel good to come home everyday
                                    knowing that my work made it so someone else could stay home all day as well. It’s
                                    something I am going to have to think on more for sure. It’s late and time for bed
                                    though. So hopefully I will remember to check in with you again tomorrow. If I
                                    don’t though, just know that I am doing work on my website and am so involved with
                                    it that I really can’t take 10 minutes to write anything out. That is really how it
                                    is too. When I am on a roll, I can’t be stopped for anything lol. Anywho,
                                    Goodnight.

                                    I am currently at work. It's a Sunday, so I get to be here by myself. That can be a
                                    good thing, or that can be a bad thing. It can be good because I don't get in to
                                    any projects, so if I have down time I can come back to my office and work on this
                                    stuff. That is because I have no boss here or anything though. If he was here I
                                    obviously could not be on my computer. It can be a bad thing to though. There can
                                    sometimes be even more work on the weekends then there is during the weekdays, and
                                    with me being the only person here, it can get pretty hectic. I have gotten some
                                    stuff done as far as my website though. Really, I just added this entire "Daily
                                    Grind" sections in. So alllll of the stuff I have written in this journal is now
                                    loaded in. I am getting pretty excited at how close I am to being finished. I say
                                    that now, but really I still have to do all the media query stuff and breakpoints
                                    and so on and so forth. I have no expierience with all that yet, so it could
                                    potentially take me quite awhile to get it all good. I am being summoned by the
                                    nurses though, so I gotta go do my job (sigh). I will be back in a little bit
                                    though. I'm still at work, but I only have 45 minutes left. I had to sit down and
                                    take a break though. It is super friggin hot again. The weather channel just said
                                    that the heat index is at 112 degress!!! Once again, that isn't the Arizona dry
                                    heat either. This is the Michigan, super duper freaking humid heat. The kind of
                                    heat that seriuosly makes it hard to breathe. I swear to you, if I could move to
                                    Mars, I would in a heartbeat. It would be perfect for someone like me. Cold all the
                                    time, no people around to bug me, I could just sit back and relax in my space
                                    bubble with no worries in the world, except for falling space rocks, no oxygen
                                    outside my bubble, space radiation, and Martians. Watch, it would be my luck that I
                                    would go to live on Mars and then suddenly the Martians decide to show themselves.
                                    They would all be super annoying and want to hang out all the time. Also, since
                                    they don't have much heat on Mars, they would constantly be coming over to my
                                    bubble, unannonced, and messing with my thermostat to make it 90 degrees in my
                                    bubble. LOL. Anyways, I got to go get back to work and finish everything up so I
                                    can get the hell out of here. I'll probably check back in later. I have been home
                                    from work for a few hours now. I think I was close to dying before I got home. That
                                    is seriously how hot it is out. My girlfriend is actually out there mowing the
                                    lawn. PHSYCHOPATH!!!! I tried to stop her, but she just kept saying that it's gonna
                                    storm so it has to get done. Well I sure as hell wasn't gonna do it today. She
                                    knows I have Tuesday off and would have done it, so that's on her if she passes
                                    out. LOL. I'm joking. Anyways, I started back on the website when I got home and
                                    got involved with a fancy new toy to put on the site. A side navigation bar for all
                                    the tutorial pages. I am close to being done with it, but there are a few things
                                    that I have to tweak to get it just right and I know that it will end up taking me
                                    a lot longer than I would have expected. So, I decided to put that on the
                                    backburner and continue working on the rest of the site so I can finally get it
                                    done. So, I am moving on to the style of the about page. I'll be back later.

                                <p>
                                    Let me apologize for not coming back last night when I said I would. OK, apology
                                    accepted. Thank You. I am home from work on my lunch break. I had to come home
                                    because it is even hotter than yesterday and I don't have air conditioning in my
                                    car. I was not about to sit in that oven and roast to death. So I figured I would
                                    come home and get in like 15 minutes of work on the website. So, I am going to go
                                    do that. I'll check back in later. In the little 15 minutes I was able to work on
                                    it I actually got quite a bit done to my about page, but it is time to go back to
                                    the hell that I call work. I'll be back later. Home from work. Work wise, it wasn't
                                    that awful of a day. Heat-wise, it was the worst day of my life. I can't believe
                                    how hot it ha been lately. I am sure I have said this before, but I will take a -40
                                    degree Michigan day over a 95 degree Michigan day every day of the week. I have
                                    Norse heritage (All my Danes and Swedes what's uuuuup!!!) and we weren't built for
                                    weather like this. Thank goodness I am home now though and I have tomorow off of
                                    work. I do not think I will be leaving my house at all in that time. If I put
                                    enough work in on the website there is actually a decent chance of finishing it by
                                    tomorow night. At least the regular laptop portion. I will have to do all the media
                                    queries and breakpoints still. I have been doing a bit of research on how to do it,
                                    but I still think that doing all that might take me some time because I haven't
                                    done it before. Definitly something I need to learn though. So I am off to continue
                                    working. I'll try to check back later with my progress.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Uhg. It is 5:56 AM. My girlfriend decided to punch me in the head while she was
                                    sleeping and woke me up. I have an issue where if I even peak my eyes open and I
                                    can see even a sliver of the sun then I just got to get up, because thee is no
                                    going back to sleep. So, I am up, and tired. Oh, by the way, I did not miss logging
                                    entries for the last few days, I just logged them straight into “My Daily Grind” on
                                    my website. Anyways, it is kind of nice being up this early and coming outside. It
                                    has finally cooled down after the month of 150-degree days, so it is nice and cool
                                    and breezy out. It would be perfect, except for the fact that my, excuse my French,
                                    dickhead neighbors hadn’t left their dogs out all night. So as soon as I walked
                                    outside they started barking their heads off. I feel so bad for those dogs. I know
                                    they only want attention. When I walk over to the fence they both come over and
                                    just want to be recognized then they stop barking and go lay down. If they still
                                    keep barking, I just let my Pitbull / Boxer mix, Luca, out and he runs over to the
                                    fence and shuts them up. LOL, it happens every time. Don’t get me wrong, he is a
                                    sweetheart of a dog, but he is the boss and he knows it lol. He just runs over and
                                    does his mean bark, even though if he ever actually went face to face with them
                                    without a fence he would probably cry and pee himself, and they both run away. A
                                    side note, I think I am going to E-Mail Microsoft today. I love this Microsoft
                                    word, but don’t have the money to pay for it. I just want to ask if there is any
                                    way I could get an extension on the free trial until I possibly could come up with
                                    the money to purchase it. The answer will probably be no or they just wont respond,
                                    but it can’t hurt to ask, right? You know what, I am going to go do that right now.
                                    Then I am going to get to work on the website. I’ll check back in later. Well I’ll
                                    be damned. Big props to Microsoft and Pranav, the customer service representative
                                    that helped me. I asked, what I am sure is a pretty unreasonable request to get an
                                    extension on my free trial of word and the rep got it done. I surely do appreciate
                                    that. So thank you again Pranav and Microsoft!! I haven’t yet started working on
                                    the website. I started doing some tweaks to my computer and then went and watered
                                    the flowers. While I was out there my mentally unstable neighbor came out and
                                    started screaming. What a wacko!! I just kept telling her to have a nice day and
                                    she kept saying she is calling the cops. Every time I asked her why she just tried
                                    to make something up. I feel really bad for her husband. When I get up for work in
                                    the morning he is always leaving with his head down and with her either screaming
                                    at him or throwing stuff at him. This is the first time I have had any interaction
                                    with her, but geeze, it kind of really pissed me off. I’m back again. I just spent
                                    nearly 3 hours just trying to make a picture for the website. I will say, it is a
                                    pretty awesome picture, but still, this is why I wish my girlfriend would learn
                                    something to help me. She claims she loves doing creative things, so Photoshop
                                    should be something that she likes doing. No though, she doesn’t want to learn
                                    anything new. I am actually writing an article for the blog about never being to
                                    old to learn a new skill and all the benefits of doing it. So, I am pretty much an
                                    expert now and I am like 95% sure that she is going to get Dementia in the next 3
                                    years because she refuses to learn. I am just joking of course, but they did do a
                                    study (I forget where, but it was one of those Ivy League Universities) that said
                                    to keep learning as you grow older and you can stave off Alzheimer’s and Dementia.
                                    If I remember right it would have to be something like a new skill though. It can’t
                                    just be reading about the Kardashians and saying you are learning, just only
                                    learning about what the Kardashians are eating for breakfast nowadays. She is very
                                    determined to not learn anything though. She will scream to the mountains that she
                                    does not have time to learn a new skill, then go upstairs and watch Grey’s Anatomy
                                    for 3 hours lol. Oh, in case you were wondering, I figured out how to solve my
                                    crazy neighbor problem. If she starts getting crazy, I am just going to start
                                    recording on my cell phone and while recording announce loud and clear that she is
                                    being recorded. If she doesn’t stop being crazy, then that counts as consent to be
                                    recorded. On top of being BATSHIT CRAZY, I am fairly certain she is a terrible
                                    alcoholic. It didn’t really occur to me until a little after everything, but while
                                    she was jabberin her crazy speech she kept saying “Oh WOW! Whoa! Now you have 2
                                    pitbulls! That’s illegal! You can only have one here!” Well, I only have 1 pitbull,
                                    so she may have been seeing double! LOL!!! I am back again, for my last check in of
                                    the night. I am embarrassed, I learned something today that, if I had gone to
                                    school for this, I probably would have learned in like the first month of the first
                                    semester. That is, if you make the position of the body of your page or the HTML of
                                    your page as relative, then you can position the children of it (which would be
                                    everything) as absolute, then you can position all the elements a hell of a lot
                                    easier than I’ve been doing it. I am super excited I learnt that, but at the same
                                    time, pretty embarrassed I did not know that yet. LOL. It is time for bed though. I
                                    got to go back to work tomorrow. When I get home, I have to go back through my
                                    entire website and fix all the positioning now. It should help with the
                                    responsiveness of it very much though. I’m tired though, so Goodnight.

                                    Just got home from work. The heat is really starting to take a toll on me. It
                                    wasn’t even that hot today (comparatively speaking. It was still in the upper 80’s
                                    but compared to 110, it’s not that hot), but I am still feeling totally rundown. I
                                    have a specific kind of headache I get when I am dealing with the heat and I have
                                    had it all day. Anyways, while I was at work I finished the JavaScript article for
                                    the “Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How” series I am doing for the website. I
                                    have only done HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so far, but I have already filled up an
                                    entire notebook. I started on another one today to. XML, which by the looks of it,
                                    is going to be very short and hard to write. I didn’t really know much of anything
                                    about XML and I did a bunch of research today and feel like I still don’t really
                                    know what XML is. The only reason I am doing it is because for the first part of
                                    5WH (I am just going to call it that for shorthand so I don’t have to type it out
                                    every time) I am focusing on Front-End Development and I was going to do AJAX next
                                    but since XML is part of AJAX I figured I should do that first. I am going to get
                                    to work on the website though. I probably won’t get much done because my girlfriend
                                    already yelled at me that I have to get out from down here and hang out with her
                                    today, and she is right. I do need to hang out with her more. So, I am going to get
                                    started before I end up not being able to get anything done.

                                    Home from work. I slept like crap late night, so I am pretty tired. For like the
                                    last week and a half I have been waking up almost exactly 45 minutes before my
                                    alarm goes off for some reason. I have always had sleeping issues though. The
                                    doctor actually prescribed me sleeping pills before, but they made me feel worse in
                                    the morning than if I hadn’t slept. Oh well, just something I have to deal with.
                                    Let’s start with what I ended up doing last night, since I never checked back in.
                                    Last night I got next to nothing done. That is because I tried to figure out how
                                    caching works in Rails, but I couldn’t really get it going. So after that, even
                                    though my website was still running ok, I wanted to get rid of all the stuff I had
                                    done to it. Let me tell you, they don’t make finding answers easy online for
                                    someone that doesn’t have much experience. It is just assumed that people know how
                                    to do the simple things or something. All I wanted to do is go back to my last
                                    commit on GitHub. It took me about an hour of searching online until I finally
                                    found out how, and it really was super simple. Just type git revert and then the
                                    commit ID. After I finally got that done, all I really had time to do is to change
                                    my about page over to all percentage measurements before my girl got home. I found
                                    a bunch more things I want to try out on my site too, but I am not going to do it
                                    today because I tend to break everything when I start dilly dallying around with
                                    all the inner workings of it all. What else??? Oh, while I was at work today I kind
                                    of gave up on the XML thing. I am still going to do it, just putting it off. I am
                                    going to do the Who, What, When, Where Why, and How’s of Git next. Maybe I will
                                    learn something useful too. I am off to go get some work done though.

                                    Sorry I didn’t check in yesterday, I did get some stuff done though. Unfortunately,
                                    yesterday was just trying to fix my website which I broke again. I am making a rule
                                    right now. NO MORE MESSING WITH EVERYTHING!!! JUST DO THE BEST I CAN ON MY SITE NOW
                                    AND GET IT DONE!!! I can mess around with stuff after my website is done and I
                                    don’t have to worry about breaking whatever I am working on. Also, today I tried to
                                    do the Git revert command that I had learned just a couple days ago, and guess
                                    what? It didn’t work for some reason. I love technology and computers and
                                    everything, but sometimes it can be a really finicky, confusing, pain in the ass
                                    thing. Everything is fixed now, for the most part, and I even have almost finished
                                    a pretty cool navigation menu for the navigation of the tutorials section of my
                                    website. Really, if I stop messing around and breaking everything every other day,
                                    there is no reason I can’t have it done within the next week or week and a half.
                                    Then I can focus on some other projects and writing some quality content for the
                                    website, which I already have a couple weeks of material written out. It just needs
                                    to be typed out and put in. I won’t be able to do much more tonight though. My
                                    girlfriend is getting upset that I am doing this all th time. I know she said she
                                    understand that I took a bet out on myself, so I need to make this work. Which
                                    means spending a lot of time down here doing everything. She actually hasn’t really
                                    said anything about me doing it either, but I can tell that she is getting upset.
                                    So, at least for tonight, I am going to go watch some movies with her and that kind
                                    of stuff. It sucks, but is also kind of cool and good I would imagine, that I
                                    literally could do this all day and not really get sick of it. It sucks though
                                    because when I am not doing all of this, that’s all I can think about and want to
                                    do. LOL. I sound like I am in love with programming. That’s, that’s kind of weird
                                    HAH. Anyways, it’s time to log off and go do that stuff. I will be back in the
                                    morning though. I am sure it will be bright and early in the morning at that,
                                    because I am physically incapable of sleeping in anymore. So, Goodnight.

                                    I knew it! I am literally incapable of sleeping in anymore. I didn’t go to bed
                                    until about 2 A.M. last night and do you know what time I woke up? Freaking 6 A.M.!
                                    There was no chance of going back to sleep either. Once I wake up and I see even a
                                    sliver of light coming through the blinds in my room it’s over. So, this is how I
                                    go through my life now. Not getting nearly enough sleep. UHG. Oh well, I have been
                                    messing around for about 2 hours just cruising the interwebs, but now it’s time to
                                    get to work. I will check back in, in a little bit. I’m back. I added my custom
                                    navigation menu to almost all the other tutorial pages. I got stuck on the
                                    reference and questions page though. I have to go side by side with another one of
                                    the pages and copy the layout or something, because no matter what I did, it just
                                    would not format right. It was getting super aggravating. I think I am going to
                                    give it a rest for a little bit. I might type up another article or 2. Also, I have
                                    to think of some sort of design for my homepage. Other than the homepage I have to
                                    tweak the contacts page, the cool contact page too, and then just get that nav menu
                                    working and it will be all done! When I am done with it I am going to go back to
                                    learning for awhile, only like a couple weeks, and then start on building something
                                    else. Actually, I should get my portfolio page done too. So, the plan is to get the
                                    website done. That should be a week and a half, tops. Then do my portfolio page.
                                    Since that is only going to be 1 page, it really shouldn’t take me that long. I’ll
                                    give myself a week and a half for that to though. I also am going on vacation for 5
                                    days in the middle of all that, so I have to minus the time out for that. Then, it
                                    will be back to some tutorials before I start on something else.

                                    After the last time I checked in yesterday, I actually got quite a bit done. First
                                    let me tell you this. My mom came over yesterday, just to hang out for a little
                                    bit. Let me say, my mom can sometimes be a bit of a Debbie Downer. She never really
                                    believed I could self-teach myself this stuff and pretty much thought I was making
                                    a huge mistake by not taking some of those jobs. She isn’t so much a Debbie Downer
                                    as she just thinks practically. She would say without proper schooling that there
                                    is no way I would ever get a job in this field and that kind of stuff. Which she is
                                    right about, for most careers. Well, she finally got a chance for the first time to
                                    actually look at what I am building and see some of the work I am putting in. She,
                                    I think, now thinks that I could possibly turn this into a career. She was
                                    thoroughly impressed. Not just with the website, which she was definitely impressed
                                    by, but also by how good of a writer I am. I believe I have told you before, that
                                    this is not writing something. This is just jotting down my thoughts. I have always
                                    been told I am a good writer. Anyways, it felt pretty good to get some validation
                                    from her. She is just a worrier, as I am, and if something isn’t practical then she
                                    doesn’t think I should do it. Self-teaching myself programming is not practical to
                                    her at all. Now though, I think I turned her into a believer. Now for the stuff I
                                    got done last night. I made quite a few tweaks here and there, but the major thing
                                    I got done was taking that program, Waka Time, and embedding the production graph
                                    into my “Daily Grind” page. Then I used a little CSS to make it so that when you
                                    hover the mouse over it, it zooms way in. That is because the graph itself was
                                    pretty big, like take up half the page big. So, I shrunk it way down and put the
                                    hover effect on it. I have to say it looks pretty cool. I am going to go try to get
                                    some work in though. My girl get’s home early tonight, so I probably won’t be able
                                    to work on it for to long. I will try to check back in though.
                                </p>

                                    Sorry I never checked back in last night. I ended up downloading this different IDE
                                    called RadRails and it turned out to be a particularly nasty virus. It even deleted
                                    my system restore points! I managed to get everything up and running again with
                                    safe mode and the command line. Why do people make viruses? Is it seriously just to
                                    be assholes? Anyways, you can probably guess that I didn’t get much done yesterday,
                                    so there is nothing to report on with that. At work yesterday and today I have been
                                    doing the 5W’s and the H on Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I am going to get started on
                                    the site though, because I have wasted way to much time recently.
                                </p>

                                    I didn’t get a whole lot done yesterday. All I got done was getting the layout
                                    right for my cool contact page. I added an old answering machine image and a comic
                                    book looking sound bubble. In photoshop I added a leave a message after the beep
                                    message and the sound cloud say says beep and that is where I am putting the
                                    contact form. I think it looks pretty cool. I am also going to throw in a little
                                    easter egg, that when you click on the play button on the answering machine it will
                                    play one of those cheesy messages from the 90’s lol. I forgot to mention right now
                                    I am just home for lunch. I wanted to install a remote desktop viewer so I can mess
                                    with stuff on my computer from work on my phone. I don’t know how well it will
                                    work, but we will see. I actually gotta get going back to work now, but I will be
                                    back in a little bit. Hasta La Vista! That was stupid. I’ll be back later. Hey look
                                    at that!! I`m at work right now typing on my computer which is at home. Ok so
                                    that’s cool. Let’s see if I can control everything though. I’m home again. I didn’t
                                    end up having much time to mess around with the team viewer thing at work, but
                                    still it was pretty cool. I did end up taking a look at the app I used to use all
                                    the time to learn. The SoloLearn app. Nothing on it had really changed, but I
                                    decided to start the JQuery tutorial on it again. Like I said though, it got busy
                                    at work, so I didn’t have much of a chance to mess with it either. I am ready to
                                    get to work though. I’ll try to check back in later. Shiggity Schweet!! I have been
                                    scared of doing the media queries and breakpoints and everything to make the
                                    website all the way responsive, but today I decided to take a stab at it. It is way
                                    easier than I was thinking it was going to be. I pretty much thought I would almost
                                    have to redo the entire site for each query for some reason. Nope! After about 30
                                    minutes of learning how to do everything the right way I got started. I only worked
                                    on everything for about 2 hours and got 2 of the pages done. It only took that long
                                    because I had to stop and look some stuff up to make sure I was doing it the right
                                    way. So, YOU KNOW WHAT!! Even though the site isn’t all the way done, I think it is
                                    close enough to where I could probably buy the hosting and stuff out of this check,
                                    which is in 2 days. I’M EXCITED! I really love doing all this stuff a lot. I really
                                    hope someone gives me a chance to make a living doing this. That would be a dream
                                    come true. I hope that potential employers would be able to look at this journal
                                    and the charts that I am embedding in the site and stuff and see that with a little
                                    bit of guidance, I could be really, really good at this. I just need someone to
                                    show me the proper way and I will put in a crazy amount of work. There has got to
                                    be someone out there that will take a chance on me. Anyways, it is time for bed. I
                                    will see you tomorrow. Goodnight.

                                    I woke up at about 6:3 0 A.M. today, even though I didn’t have work. BLAHHHH!!! I
                                    hate not being able to sleep in. Anyways, right when I got up I came down and
                                    started work. I got through a couple more pages of media queries. I just got way to
                                    tired though and had to go take a nap. I went upstairs and put on this show I like
                                    called “Preacher” (which by the way I highly recommend if you’re a Tarentino fan.
                                    He doesn’t have anything to do with the show, but it is very much his style.
                                    Actually, now that I think about it, they actually referenced Pulp Fiction in the
                                    episode I just watched. HAH) and laid down. I ended up being up there for 5
                                    FREAKING hours being unproductive!! I hate being unproductive! I am back now
                                    though, and I am going to get some work in.

                                    Just got home from work. It was my late day today so instead of getting out at 4 I
                                    got out at 6 today. I hate these long Fridays. Nothing ever goes on there after
                                    4:30, so I don’t know why they make us do that. It was busy at work for most of the
                                    day though, so I didn’t get to much done. I wrote a little bit about Ruby on Rails
                                    framework for that series I am going to do, but that’s about it. I am going to go
                                    get some work in now though.

                                    Uhg. Today is going to be a long day. First, it was hot as hell in my house last
                                    night, so I could not sleep. I eventually got about 2 hours of sleep, but my
                                    girlfriend opened the door to our room to let airflow in. My pitbull/boxer mix Luca
                                    took that as an invitation, so at 6 A.M. I woke up and all I could see was his
                                    snout in my face lol. So, I got up and just stayed up. Now I am at work and tired
                                    as hell. I didn’t end up getting much done last night. This stupid side bar I have
                                    on some of the pages on my site keep messing everything up. So, I am just going to
                                    get rid of it today. Last night that’s all I did is mess with the sidebar and I
                                    tried out some different code editors. None were as good as VS Code though, in my
                                    opinion. It is time for me to go get to work though, as they are paging me right
                                    now. TODAY IS GOING TO SUCK! LOL! I called that. I don’t know why, but the
                                    residents are being just plain mean today. Sometimes it is funny, but other times
                                    you kind of want to give it back to them. You can’t though because they are old and
                                    don’t know any better lol. I have been home for about 4 hours. I didn’t get much
                                    more done at work. It was pretty busy today, so I didn’t have a chance to. When I
                                    got home I had to do a bunch of yard work. So, I barely got anything done today. I
                                    did however come up with a logo and a slogan and already have them made. It is 2
                                    muscly arms flexing, making the &lt &gt coding symbol around the letters K.O., and
                                    underneath that it says coding. Then the catchphrase, which is right under that,
                                    says “Let me do the heavy lifting for you”. LOL. I think it is pretty awesome and
                                    pretty funny. I am going to try to get like a half hour of work in though, before I
                                    have to go watch T.V. or something. I probably won’t be checking back in tonight
                                    so, Goodnight.

                                    I am at work. I really don’t feel like being here at all today. Anyone who reads
                                    this, I am guessing, might think that I am not a good worker or something. I hope
                                    that I have not made it sound that way through this. You have to understand my job
                                    though. Maintenance at a nursing home can be pretty cool but it can also be the
                                    worst thing ever. Any injuries are immediately your fault. This is because the
                                    nurses won’t say they did something wrong, so it was my fault because I didn’t put
                                    bed rails on or something. Well, I can’t put on bed rails without an order from
                                    them, but it still ends up my fault. It’s a lot of stuff like that. Everything is
                                    my fault when things go bad, but when things go right it is clearly because of
                                    them. Also, I really don’t like what I do. If I had a job I enjoyed, sayyyyy web
                                    development, I would be taking my work home with me probably every day. Just
                                    because I enjoy doing it. I could sit and do this for 18 hours every day, no
                                    problem lol. UHHHHHHHHG! I am being summoned. I am sure it is for something that is
                                    clearly my fault because it always is. I’ll be back. That call I went on was one of
                                    the worst calls I ever got. You want to know a good reason for me wanting to switch
                                    careers? On that call I just went on I got shitty poo poo water in my freaking eye.
                                    I bet that doesn’t happen too often as a web developer. It was a clogged toilet. No
                                    matter how many times you tell these people that those wipes are not flushable,
                                    they still flush them. Well while I was plunging something happened to make the
                                    water come up with a lot of pressure and splat. It wasn’t a lot of poo water, but a
                                    friggin speck of poo water is to much poo water to get in your eye. Now I will
                                    probably get pink eye or something. I AM FREAKING BEGGING SOMEONE OUT THERE TO TAKE
                                    A CHANCE ON ME. I PROMISE IT WILL NOT BE A MISTAKE AND I WILL WORK MY BUTT OFF FOR
                                    YOU!!! Anyways beside the poo eye catastrophe the rest of the day was busy as well,
                                    so I didn’t get much done. I did write some more about Ruby on Rails and that is
                                    almost done and I started typing out the JavaScript article. Since I am home now, I
                                    am going to relax for a little and try to get some more done before I have to go
                                    outside and finish trimming the hedges. I’ll be back.

                                    I, once again, apologize for not checking back in last night. I got a lot
                                    accomplished though. I got rid of the stupid sidebar that was giving me loads of
                                    trouble, but I replaced it with a fixed position scrolling one. It looks much, much
                                    better now. Then I fixed the layout of those pages that had the side bar to make
                                    them match with the new one. I also fixed the navigation menu and incorporated my
                                    new logo and catch phrase into it. So, all I have to do know is finish the last 2
                                    tutorial pages with the new sidebar. Then I have to finish my media queries, which
                                    shouldn’t take any longer than a day. Then I have to do my homepage. UHHHG! The
                                    most important page of my freaking website and I have no idea what to do with it. I
                                    am going to go ahead and at least get the rest of it done, then I will worry about
                                    that. IT’S ALMOST TIME THOUGH!! IT IS NEARING COMPLETION! HOW EXCITING! So, I
                                    haven’t really gotten anything done…. Because I am a dummy. For whatever reason I
                                    decided that “Hey ! This would be a good time to back up my computer”. I started
                                    the backing up process, only to realize that backing up my computer might be kind
                                    of labor intensive on the computer. Since it is labor intensive it makes everything
                                    I try to do to my site very laggy. So, instead of working on the site I decided to
                                    check out some web hosting providers. I think I am going to go with IPage. I have
                                    that all settled, but now the back up is only half way done and I can’t work on my
                                    project. I have nothing to do. I don’t like that one bit. I have to stay
                                    productive. I may have to just deal with the lag , because being unproductive is my
                                    least favorite thing in the world. Actually, I know what I am going to do. I am
                                    going to go outside and water everything, and then do the dishes. By then the
                                    backup should be done. However, my girlfriend will be home to. She will want me to
                                    hang out with her. So, it looks like I am not going to be able to be productive. I
                                    am going to go do the watering and dishes. Maybe I will get lucky and my girlfriend
                                    won’t want to see my face tonight. HAH. I’m just joking. Anyways, I am going to go
                                    do that. I’ll check back in later. Well, it’s 9:30 and the backup in finally done.
                                    I have to go shower and stuff and then maybe I might be able to get in like a half
                                    hour of work. Oh, really quick funny story first. I always do the yard work.
                                    ALWAYS! My girlfriend get’s mad about it because she thinks that I think that she
                                    doesn’t know how to do anything. She got out the weed and feed spray a couple days
                                    ago to kill the weeds in our lawn. I didn’t stop her, like I normally would have.
                                    Well… LOL!. I go out there today to water everything and she must have sprayed
                                    EVERYTHING, not just the lawn. All the flowers in the yard are dying, this pine
                                    tree thing we have is turning brown, and these 2 huge like 10 feet tall and like 10
                                    feet in diameter bushes lost all of their leaves or the leaves are brown. Maybe she
                                    will finally concede to me that she should not be doing stuff anymore. Uh Oh. I do
                                    believe she just got home. HAHA. She is trying to say that it wasn’t her. I think
                                    she listened to Shaggy a little bit to much, because it was clearly her that did
                                    it.

                                    It is 6:30 A.M. and I don’t have work today. Of course, I wake up 20 minutes before
                                    my alarm would have gone off for work. I just find that extremely annoying. Plus, I
                                    don’t feel very good. My stomach is doing flips like crazy. Fortunately, that just
                                    gives me more of an excuse to not do anything but work all day. So, I am off to
                                    start that. I will be back later. It’s 1 P.M. now. Been working all day so far.
                                    Mostly just working on making everything responsive still. I think I only have like
                                    2 pages left to make responsive, then I have to finish my contact form, then my
                                    homepage. The contact form is almost done and so is the making everything
                                    responsive. I still have no idea what to do for my homepage though. If I have to,
                                    just so I can get the site deployed and all that, I will just put my logo on it
                                    really big and then just links to all the other pages. I hate to do that though. I
                                    want something really snazzy for my homepage. If it comes down to it though, then I
                                    will have to just do that for the time being. I just don’t want to lose out on any
                                    visitors or anything because they think my homepage looks amateur, so they don’t
                                    even look at the rest of the site. I don’t know, I’ll figure it out though. Woop! I
                                    did 10 hours of work today. I am sure that it is not a record for me, but still
                                    that is pretty good. I really like these time-keeping apps. The Waka-Time and
                                    Code-Alike. I think that they will help me greatly when it come time to find a job
                                    doing this because I will be able to prove how much time I put in. Anyways, I got
                                    quite a bit done today. I got like 5 more pages finished with the responsiveness. I
                                    would have got more done, but I got stuck on 1 page for like 2 and a half hours
                                    before I finally said “Screw It” to the design I was going to do, and did something
                                    different. So let’s see, I have to finish the responsiveness on the contact page.
                                    Mooc tutorials, video tutorials, and reference and questions pages are half-way
                                    done with responsiveness. Then I have to do something with the homepage still, then
                                    finish linking the form from my contact page to the database and I will be done.
                                    OH!, and I have to make a second navigation menu for the tutorial pages. Overall
                                    that all shouldn’t take long. I say that by Monday I will be done. So, 6 days. I
                                    got to go though, as I am being yelled at. I’ll be back tomorrow. Goodnight.

                                    Just got home from work and blah, blah, blah no one cares. It’s friggin hot as hell
                                    out again. It’s making me so grumpy and miserable. I got some more writing done at
                                    work. I am almost done with the 5WH of Ruby. So that will give me HTML, CSS,
                                    JavaScript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails that I will be able to post on the website. I
                                    am going to go get some work done on the site though. It would be nice to get
                                    through the responsiveness of the rest of the tutorial pages tonight. I’ll try to
                                    check back in before I lay down for the night. I’m back. I just wasted the entire
                                    day. Today just hasn’t been a very good day. I started doing a different menu for
                                    the tutorials page and then I saw a different menu that I liked for the entire
                                    site. So, I spent alllllll day trying to get it just right. I never did. Tomorrow I
                                    might play around with it for just like a half hour and if I don’t get it to start
                                    doing what I want it to, then I am just going to go back to the one I had. There’s
                                    nothing wrong with the one I had at all. I will say the one I am trying to do now
                                    does look much cooler, but I don’t need to waste 2 entire days trying to get it to
                                    work. So yeah….. not much progress today at all. What a wasted day. I apologize and
                                    I’ll work extra hard tomorrow and this weekend especially. I AM GOING TO FINISH IT
                                    THIS WEEKEND DAMMIT!!! Then I can start working on some other stuff finally. It is
                                    time to go hang out with my girl for a little bit and then to bed though, so
                                    Goodnight.

                                    Well todays not starting out any better than yesterday. I just got home from work
                                    and was thinking that I was going to be able to start right in on working, but I my
                                    mother just called, and I got to run to her house. I shouldn’t be gone long, but
                                    that definitely puts a damper on what I was planning on getting done today. While I
                                    was at work I finished writing the 5wh of Ruby and started on Python. After Python
                                    I think I will do Django and then switch to a few tools. I had started one on Git
                                    and GitHub, so I will probably go back and finish that one. Then I think I need to
                                    do another opinion piece like my “How to not be intimidated by the Matrix” piece. I
                                    have to take off to my mom’s now though. I will be back in a little bit.
                                </p>

                                    Sorry I never got back around to checking back in yesterday. I got a little bit
                                    done though. I finished the media queries for 3 more tutorial pages. Then today I
                                    came home on lunch and knocked out one more. All I have left, as far as the
                                    tutorial pages go, is the tools page. After that I am going to make a navigation
                                    menu for the tutorial pages and they will be done. Then all I will have left is the
                                    final touches and media queries on the contact page and doing something with the
                                    homepage. So, I am going to go get to work now. I’ll try to remember to check back
                                    in, in a little bit. UHG! Pretty much another wasted day. I did get the rest of the
                                    tutorial page responsiveness done, except for a little bi on the interactive
                                    tutorials that I forgot about. Then I spent like 3 hours trying to get inspiration
                                    for a nav menu for the tutorials pages. I never got it. It’s late now too so I
                                    won’t be getting anything else done. I am going to try to type up a little bit of
                                    the “Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How’s of JavaScript” before I get yelled at
                                    though. I am going to do that now. I probably won’t be back tonight, so Goodnight.
                                </p>

                                    It’s 9 P.M. on Saturday night. I am remembering to check in though. I got quite a
                                    bit done today. I finished all the media queries and started on a new nav menu for
                                    the tutorial pages. I have a pretty cool one. I am done with it I just have to put
                                    it on each of the pages and do the media queries. Anyways, the menu is just a set
                                    of 6 short and wide divs that are colored in and say “Book Tutorials” and “Video
                                    Tutorials” etc. and when you hover over one of them it grows by about 3X and has a
                                    funny GIF pertaining to whatever kind of tutorial it is. Pretty cool. I learned a
                                    lot today to. How to resize and compress GIF’s, and I learned a lot about how to
                                    make everything responsive without media queries. I have been thinking… After I get
                                    done with my website, I am going to have to go back and redo the whole thing. I
                                    want the website to be pretty uniform with the measurements and all that stuff, and
                                    right now it is all over the place. I am picking up so much new knowledge as I go
                                    and haven’t gone back and redone the things that I could have. If I had done that,
                                    then I would not be nearly as far along as I am now though. Which also means that I
                                    probably wouldn’t have learned the things that I have. So yeah , I think I am doing
                                    it the right way. Finish the site, then go back and redo it with all my new
                                    knowledge. I have to be done for at least a little while though. I got to go and
                                    shower and hang out with my love for a while. I’ll try to at least get some more of
                                    the 5WH done tonight though. Goodnight.

                                    It’s 7A.M. Sunday morning. No sleeping in again, even though I stayed up like 3
                                    hours past when I normally do. I think that I am old now. Like it’s official. I
                                    remember my grandpa Dick always getting up at about 5 in the morning no matter
                                    what. That’s me now. I already complain like crazy about todays youth, hate all of
                                    there music, hate how liberal they all are and feel like they don’t know shit yet
                                    because they haven’t lived in the real world. I already spend my free time tending
                                    to my lawn and flowers and get mad when someone walks on it. It’s true, I am the
                                    oldest 32-year-old ever. I might as well go get some loafers, get a subscription to
                                    the AARP magazine, and start eating dinner at 5 P.M., as old people tend to do. I
                                    am going to chill out for a minute, maybe catch up on some news, and then get to
                                    work. I’ll be back in a little bit. I’ll catch you on the flip side. Is that
                                    something the young folk say? HAH. I’ll be back later. It’s 7:30 P.M. and I don’t
                                    really know how to feel about today. I didn’t really get much done as far as the
                                    site goes. I did figure out some other useful thing though. I learned a little more
                                    about how Git works through a mistake I made. I had let merged a branch that was
                                    farther behind another one and yada yada yada, I don’t really know how to explain
                                    it, but I think everything is in working order now. I did totally finish my
                                    tutorial nav menu though, but do you know what I realized as soon as I finished
                                    it!!!??? If I really want it to be responsive I can’t have hover events because
                                    touchscreens don’t have mouses!!! So now I have to go back and make another friggin
                                    nav menu. I also got signed up for Reddit the right way so I could ask questions
                                    that are more than 140 characters long. I got some good advice there. I also asked
                                    a few questions on Quora and got some ok responses, even though I got in an
                                    argument with one guy. I don’t know. Today was kind of an all over the place day. I
                                    got little work done, but overall, I learned a lot. I also figured out that I had a
                                    branch behind my master branch on GitHub because I pushed my app to Heroku so I
                                    could actually look at it on my cell phone and make sure it’s responsive. I figured
                                    it out because there were 3 or 4 pages that I know I made responsive that were not
                                    being responsive at all on my phone. So, I am glad I got that figured out. I also
                                    saw how much work I have left to do though. The responsive design mode on Mozilla
                                    Firefox is OK, but there was a lot of stuff that looked OK in the browser that once
                                    I looked at it from my phone did not look OK at all. There is no chance of me
                                    having this done this week like I was thinking. I guess I have to give myself quite
                                    a bit more time. I am going to be a little generous with my timeframe this time,
                                    since I am going on vacation next week and everything. I guess I will give myself
                                    till September 1st, even though I really don’t think it will take me that long. I
                                    thought I would be done July 1st too though and look how that turned out. I just
                                    wanted to check in really quick on my crazy day though. I am going to get back to
                                    work, I will try to check in again in a little bit, but if I don’t, then I will see
                                    you tomorrow. Goodnight.

                                    Home from work finally. Let me tell you, it has been a day. First thing, it was
                                    about 95 degrees today, and that’s real temperature. It was also like 80% humidity
                                    too, so the real feel temperature was somewhere closer to 110 degrees. Absolutely
                                    miserable. Next, just everyone had an attitude today. That could have been from the
                                    heat or maybe I did something to piss everyone off. Then, since it was to hot to
                                    sit in my car with no A.C. for lunch I came home and got a little work done. On my
                                    way back to work I got a flat tire and my car is still sitting in the Lowes parking
                                    lot. Then while I was taking out the garbage at work, Mother Nature, decided to
                                    treat me to a torrential downpour and about as close as you can come to a tornado
                                    without there actually being one. The rain proceeded to stop, as soon as I got
                                    inside again. Then after begging my buddy / coworker for a ride home, I finally
                                    made it here ANNNNND….. The dog shit on the carpet. LOL. WHAT A DAY!! I’m almost
                                    afraid to go do anything else today. I am a bit scared to work on my site at all.
                                    Who knows what kind of bullshit will happen. I am going to do it anyways though.
                                    So, off to work I go. About 30 minutes after I got working, ANOTHER THING HAPPENED.
                                    My girl came home from work sick, so for the last 2 hours I have been having to run
                                    to the pharmacy and store and everything to make sure she is ok. Things just keep
                                    happening. I am going to get back to work for a little bit. I only have about an
                                    hour and a half to do anything, so I have to make it count.

                                    Well last night I didn’t get much of anything done again. It was a very bad day.
                                    Today hasn’t been much better. I still don’t have my car because I don’t have the
                                    money for a tire till tomorrow, so I had to get rides and borrow cars all day. Then
                                    at work, I accidently spilled a cup of ice water on a resident, then when I started
                                    doing what I was in there to do and clean out the back of her PTAC, I turned on the
                                    wet vac. Dietary must have used it a while back and never cleaned it, because when
                                    I turned it on the most awful smell in the world came out. I felt so bad, but it
                                    was just one of those days. The rest of the day wasn’t much better. At least I get
                                    to start vacation now. No work for a week!! I won’t be getting much of anything
                                    done on here for that time either. I rented a cabin for me and my girlfriend and if
                                    I spent much time on here she would freak out and get mad lol. So, the only time I
                                    will be able to get any work done on here is early in the morning when I inevitably
                                    wake up hours before her, and even then, I don’t think I will be able to get any
                                    website work done. I don’t know if there is wifi there, so I might only be able to
                                    type out some of my articles. That is fine though. I need to get that stuff done
                                    too. I am going to get going on the site though and hopefully make some actual
                                    progress. So, I did manage to make a bit of progress today. I finally made a main
                                    navigation menu that stays responsive and gives me the room to put all the stuff I
                                    wanted to in there. I don’t have a good tutorials one yet, but its not far off
                                    because I’m lowering my standards a bit. I keep thinking of more and more things
                                    that.

                                    Sorry I abruptly left last night. My dog started chasing something and then must
                                    have nipped it because it let out a loud scream. It scared the hell out of me.
                                    After that I went inside. Anyways, it is 7 A.M. and I am awake, with no work. I do
                                    have to drop my girl off at work so that I can use her car today to fix mine. Today
                                    hasn’t seemed much better than my last few days so far. Everyone is rushing me and
                                    calling me and asking me to do stuff and for stuff. That’s all within like an hour
                                    of each other too. I finally got back to my car and got my tire off. Tried calling
                                    around for a used tire and nobody had one. 2 guys actually snickered at me and
                                    said, “Good luck finding one of those used”. Another guy told me he could get 12 of
                                    those kind in, in the morning and they would be gone by noon. Thank goodness I
                                    finally found someone that had one though. As far as working on the site goes, I
                                    worked on trying to do something to the main one for like 2 hours and I couldn’t
                                    get it. So, instead of messing around till I broke everything, I just left well
                                    enough alone and decided to implement what I was trying to do in a different way. I
                                    almost got it done too. I only have to set some media queries and that will be
                                    done. Then I will have to do the same thing for 6 other pages, but at least I will
                                    know that it can be accomplished, since I will have already done it on 1 of the
                                    pages. I have to go pick up my girlfriend from work and take her to the salon where
                                    she does nails. Then go put my tire on and run one other place, then I should be
                                    done with all that crap till my girl gets out of work at 8. Actually, I am looking
                                    at the time now, and I will only have like an hour to work before she gets out of
                                    work. This is why I don’t do vacations. It is just way too stressful. My left eye
                                    literally feels like its about to pop out of my head right now, and I know its from
                                    stress. Stress, for me, is both a curse and a blessing. It’s a curse because I
                                    stress way too much, and it will probably be what ends up killing me. On the other
                                    hand, I always seem to perform my best under stress. If you told me I have 30
                                    minutes to complete a job that would normally take 2 hours, and my job or something
                                    depended on it, not only will I complete it, It will be some of the best work you
                                    have ever seen. Even though I don’t have a real time limit, I want to get what I
                                    was talking about before done by the time I leave tomorrow. Oh crap, its 15 to 5
                                    and I gotta pick up my girlfriend. I’ll be back later. I am back. I made it there
                                    with time to spare. I only have about an hour to get some work done though, so off
                                    I go.
                                </p>

                                    Good morning. I actually slept till 8 A.M. today. That is like 2 hours more than I
                                    normally do. Today is the last day for 4 days that I will be able to get any work
                                    done on the site. I’ll only be able to get a little work done, at that. I am
                                    leaving to go on vacation today. I checked the wifi coverage where I am going and
                                    there is none. So, I will still be able to get some stuff typed out, but I won’t be
                                    able to work on the site, unless I find some sort of internet emulator for my local
                                    machine before I go. Actually, I am going to go try to find that now. I have great
                                    news!! Don’t tell my girlfriend though. I had no idea that the Rails Server does
                                    not need to connect to the internet for me to work. So, that means, at least while
                                    my girlfriend is sleeping, that I will be able to get some work done while I am on
                                    vacation!! That is awesome. Just finished the nav menu media queries for another
                                    tutorials page. I am working on the one for paid tutorials now and after that I
                                    have 2 more and I will finally be done with those. It seems like I have been
                                    working on getting a nav menu for that section for weeks. I am kind of hating going
                                    back and doing all this. Only because I am look at the older code I have written
                                    and see so many things that I now know how to do the right way. If I went back and
                                    changed everything, I might as well just make an entire new site. Which after I get
                                    this one published online, is precisely what I am going to do. I am unsure if I
                                    want to start from square one and redo the entire thing a different way, or if I
                                    want to just go back and fix everything. Probably just start from square one,
                                    because I know once I start doing all that EVERYTHIING is going to break and I will
                                    have to anyways. I sort of want to try it with a different framework. I think maybe
                                    I will do Python’s Django framework and maybe I will try Foundation by Zurb instead
                                    of Bootstrap. Maybe I will do no front-end framework at all actually. It seems that
                                    most of the time I am trying to overwrite Bootstrap’s defaults anyways. The way it
                                    is going now, I might be able to start that after vacation. I always say crap like
                                    that though and then working on it for months longer. I am serious this time
                                    though. After I finish these nav menus I have to finish the contact page and
                                    homepage and their media queries. Then possibly just add a footer across every
                                    page. I’m sure there is much more crap though. Like figuring out how caches work
                                    and implementing it, doing a Google page audit and fixing what it says, and a bunch
                                    of meta data stuff. Yeah, on second thought, I will probably be doing this same
                                    site for the next month. I am getting better though, and I will bet my next one
                                    takes me a fraction of the time to complete. I am really starting to stress. I
                                    still don’t have my check from work and its starting to get later in the day. I
                                    have to drive almost 5 hours still too. I have to leave soon too, or I will be
                                    basically wasting 200 dollars for the first night there. I am about to just drive
                                    up to my work and freaking HOPE that everything will work out. It is 9 P.M. we got
                                    to the cabin at about 8. That was 6 freaking hours of driving but were here. It is
                                    beautiful, not quite as secluded as I would have liked, but its not, not secluded
                                    either. I can’t see the couple other cabins, but I know they are there and not that
                                    far. I get a little iffy about these kind of places, probably because I have seen
                                    to many movies. I always have to check the premises for hill people and cameras
                                    LOL. I am being serious too. There is a weird room down under the cabin that I
                                    immediately had to go into and check, and I had to stand on the bed and check the
                                    chandelier lights for cameras and behind the pictures too. This is the type of
                                    place I would like to retire to though. I am not very much of a city dweller. I
                                    live literally 1 and a half miles out of the Detroit City limits and I would love
                                    to get away from it, out into the country somewhere. My perfect scenario is from
                                    the movie “Shooter” with Mark Wahlberg. He has a super nice cabin up in the
                                    mountains with no one around, he has his trusty dog companion, and he has satellite
                                    internet or something. That is the kind of life for me. I always tell people I
                                    could easily go off the grid and become a hermit in the woods and just live off the
                                    land. I would absolutely need to find a way to have internet though. Besides the
                                    internet, I wouldn’t need any other “new world” amenities. Oh, I forgot to mention
                                    that this place does have wifi as well. I still can’t be on it very much though or
                                    my girlfriend will leave me LOL. Tonight though, we are just hanging out at the
                                    cabin. Tomorrow we start going on hikes and stuff. I probably won’t be back on here
                                    tonight though, so Goodnight.
                                </p>

                                    Night one in the cabin is over. I actually slept till 8:30 this morning!! However,
                                    I didn’t go to bed till like 1:30 A.M. so that is kind of a wash. The bed isn’t all
                                    that great here. I have neck and back issues from being in wrestling and football
                                    my whole life and I need a specific kind of support or I hurt. I can’t complain
                                    though, because that type of support I can only get in my own bed. When I woke and
                                    came outside, I heard some rustling in the woods like 10 feet behind me that scared
                                    the bejesus out of me, but it was just a deer. It trotted away a little then turned
                                    around and stared at me with it’s tail wagging and started walking back towards me
                                    a little. I thought I was going to be able to pet it with how close it was getting,
                                    but it stopped short and wouldn’t come up to me. Then it trotted away. It still
                                    isn’t far. Just behind me eating. I was thinking about leaving something out for
                                    it, but that probably isn’t a good idea considering there is also bears around
                                    here. I am going to try to get a little work in before my girlfriend wakes up
                                    though. She has big plans for today, so I am sure I am going to be exhausted later.
                                    I will check in, in a bit though. Perhaps I should take some pictures and maybe add
                                    a little spice to this boring journal. We got back from our first hike about 30
                                    minutes ago. We went to “Old Mans Cave” in Hocking Hills Ohio state park. It was a
                                    beautiful 5 mile hike. There was a bit too many people, but it wasn’t too bad. I
                                    got some good pictures that I am going to put on the site and a couple that I might
                                    set as background images for my computer and stuff. I also tried to climb a cliff
                                    and ended up falling LOL. I got pretty scratched up from it, but it could have a
                                    whole lot worse. Were back now, I don’t think we are done for the day. If it rains
                                    we probably are though and it says we have a decent chance of rain. I know its kind
                                    of selfish of me, but I am kind of hoping for some rain either today or tomorrow.
                                    Well I literally just typed that last bit and out of nowhere it got very dark and
                                    windy. So, it looks like, at least for a little while, we will be just hanging out
                                    at the cabin. That’s what a vacation, in my opinion, is supposed to be. I can fall
                                    off cliffs anytime, but I don’t get time to relax often. Oh, I forgot to mention
                                    that we are pretty near Columbus, Ohio. Do you know what is in Columbus, Ohio?
                                    That’s right!, Ohio State University! The worst people in the world LOL. I joke.
                                    (not really). In case you don’t know, I am from Michigan. About a half hour drive
                                    from “The Big House” (GO BLUE!!). Earlier today me and the lady at the gas station
                                    actually started jabbing each other about the Michigan-OSU rivalry. For those that
                                    are not into sports or anything, Michigan VS. OSU is the greatest rivalry in all of
                                    sports. They have literally done polls and studies and all that crap, and it is
                                    definitely true. It is a very heated rivalry at that, to the point that if you’re
                                    from Michigan driving in Ohio, you actually have to be more cautious because the
                                    cops are WAYYYY more likely to pull you over.

                                    Woke up at 8:30 A.M. again. I am a bit sore from falling off the mountain yesterday
                                    (HAH! I know it was just a small cliff on part of the mountain, but it makes me
                                    sound more badass.) I am very tired today, and I know today is about to be our
                                    busiest day. I am going to try to get a little bit of work in before my girl wakes
                                    up though. It’s noon now. I got all the media queries and switched the fonts from
                                    em to vw done on the Tools page. It doesn’t feel like I have that much more to do,
                                    but , like I said before, everytime I feel that way, I end up finding something
                                    else to be done the right way or that I like better. I am done falling in to that
                                    trap though. Get the site up and running and then start messing with everything if
                                    I want to. I already am about 90% sure that as soon as I get done with the site I
                                    am going to redo it using different stuff and do it with all the new stuff I have
                                    learned. I have to get off of here for awhile though because I have to shave and
                                    shower and then we are going to take off to do some more hiking. I hope I don’t
                                    fall off any more mountains!! LOL! Well, we almost died. I am not really even
                                    joking. I guess I should rephrase that though. We could have died. We went and did
                                    some more trails and we went to one called Conkles Hollows. It was probably the
                                    prettiest one. It had 2 routes and we walked them both and on both of them
                                    something happened to make me feel unsafe. First, we did what is called the gorge
                                    route. It was a walk through the inside of the gorge. It was freaking beautiful,
                                    like a whole different world. When we got to the end of it, we heard some creepy
                                    group singing. W took a peek and it was a bunch of Amish, literally like 70 of them
                                    (I think, it could have been a cult.) They were singing very creepily and had
                                    circled a black family. I don’t know what was about to happen, but the black family
                                    was happy to see us. One of the kids nudged his brother and pointed at us, as if to
                                    say “Thank God, we were about to be sacrificed to the Amish god of mountains, but
                                    now that these people are here they can’t do it without witnesses.” We stayed there
                                    until the group started to clear out. When we made it back, we decided to take the
                                    other route. This one took you to the top of the gorge and all the way around it.
                                    It was about 4 miles. Well, right when we got to the top it started to storm. There
                                    was no one else on the trail either. This wasn’t like a nice trail with cement and
                                    rails. This was walking on tree roots and rocks and mud, a foot away from a 300
                                    foot drop (straight down), while it was pouring rain and thundering and lightning.
                                    We made it though (Thank the Amish Mountain God) and we are back to the cabin safe.
                                    That was all pretty nuts though.
                                </p>

                                    I only got about 4 hours of sleep last night. I am also pretty sore from the rest
                                    of the weekend. Today we go home though. Going back home from a vacation is always
                                    bittersweet for me. On one hand I love being out here in the wilderness in a cabin
                                    and just not having to worry about anything. On the other hand, I can’t wait to get
                                    home and be able to relax in my own house and and see my Luca who I am sure is
                                    going to be crazy excited to see us back. I still have 2 more days off after today,
                                    so I will be able to relax and work my sore muscles out before going back to work.
                                    I am going to have to remind my girlfriend that I am still on vacation, so she
                                    can’t get mad at me for working on the site, which should be pretty damn close to
                                    being done by the time I go back to work. I did manage to get a little bit more
                                    done last night too, but I couldn’t stay on long or I would have gotten in trouble
                                    with my girl. Today we have to rush around all morning because checkout time is at
                                    11 A.M. and it is already 9. My girl wanted to maybe go see a few more things, but
                                    I don’t know. Something about the last day of a vacation, I just feel like getting
                                    everything together and getting home. That’s how I always feel. I have to get off
                                    of here though and start packing everything up. I will check back in when we get
                                    home. HOME AT LAST! I love vacations as much as the next guy, but it feels great to
                                    return home after a vacation. I don’t know why but return trips from vacation
                                    always seem a lot shorter. It felt like it took 12 hours to get there, but on the
                                    way back it felt like 2 hours. Anyways, I am home. Time to stop playing around and
                                    to get to work.
                                </p>

                                    Sorry I forgot to write yesterday. I got a lot done though. I finally finished all
                                    the tutorial pages with the new navbar and all that and all the media queries. Once
                                    I got done, I pushed everything through to Heroku, so I could see it live on my
                                    phone. It looks pretty good! I did have to go back and make some more tweaks, which
                                    I am still working on, but the majority of it all is done. The little bit of tweaks
                                    I have to do will be done this morning, and then I can start putting the finishing
                                    touches on my contact page. That should be done today too. Then all I will have
                                    left is the Homepage, which I still have no idea what to do for. I know that the
                                    homepage has to be the best one, so I really need to put some thought in to it.
                                    After that, I should probably look in to ways to enhance performance, especially on
                                    mobile. If that is all I have to do though, then I could push it live and
                                    everything would be good to go. I could make the performance tweaks after it is
                                    already live, as long as it isn’t horrible on any devices. I am going to get to
                                    work though. It would be awesome if I got everything done today!

                                    Sorry I never checked back in yesterday. It is because I was on a role. I only got
                                    the contacts page done yesterday (actually it is almost done, I still have to do
                                    probably about 20 minutes of work) and it was a HUGE pain in the ass. That is what
                                    I get for using a snippet from someone else online though. Not that the snippet I
                                    used wasn’t any good or anything. It worked exactly as it should have, but I wanted
                                    to do some extra stuff to it and that sucked. I can’t do that anymore. Since I
                                    didn’t write that short bit of code, trying to do my own stuff to it kept breaking
                                    everything. I eventually got it, but I had to strip away like half of it. In the
                                    end it would have been better and easier just to do it myself. Oh well though. You
                                    live and learn. So, now that the contact page is about done, I have to do the Home
                                    Page and it will be all done. Of course, the homepage is the most important one and
                                    I have no idea what I want to do with it. My girlfriend keeps telling me how
                                    creative she is and that she will help me with the homepage, but she hasn’t done
                                    anything yet. She keeps asking me what I want on it and all that stuff. Well, if I
                                    knew that I wouldn’t be asking for help with it lol. You are the creative one, so
                                    be creative. Anywho, it’s time to go get some shit done. I’ll check back in later,
                                    unless I am in the zone. If that’s the case, then I will check back in tomorrow.
                                    Time to go get some work done.
                                </p>

                                    I finally finished the contact page and all the media queries!! Now all I have left
                                    is the homepage and if I want to make a separate page for the w5c articles. I am
                                    sure I have to do a bunch of other more technical tweaking too. Still though,
                                    progress is progress. I made myself learn a bunch of new stuff today too. I could
                                    not get these little icons to stop moving around when I resized the window, so I
                                    did some research and played around for awhile and got it to where they stay still
                                    when it is resizing. That is awesome to know too, because probably half of my media
                                    queries are for that reason. I’m not going to go back and do all of that though.
                                    Like I said, once I get done with the site and publish it, I am going to remake the
                                    entire thing the right way. Oh, and it has already started. My girl’s daughter has
                                    only been home for a week and I am already getting in fights with my girlfriend
                                    because of it. Does this seem like something a person with any sense of anything
                                    besides themselves would do? I am working and suddenly, I hear one of the dogs
                                    start barking like crazy. I figure it must be outside or something and that her
                                    daughter must have been the one to let it out. I am already beyond fed up with this
                                    girl from before too, so I just let the dog bark because she needs to start
                                    handling shit for herself. The dog continues barking for like 20 more minutes. It
                                    wasn’t like a I am in pain bark or anything, just a “Hey, I think you forgot about
                                    me bark”. If it was a yelp or anything I would have went right away. Anyways, I
                                    finally get tired of it and go to see what’s going on. Well, the daughter had
                                    locked the dog in her room and left. Ordinarily, this would not have pissed me off
                                    too much, but considering that every single day this girl does the stupidest thing
                                    I have ever seen, it pisses me off a lot. Yes! I did say every day is the stupidest
                                    thing ever! Meaning every day, she tops herself. Well, my girlfriend gets mad at me
                                    about it all. She gets blinded by anger and seriously makes no sense with her
                                    arguments when you insult her daughter (This is the problem). EVERYTHING ends up
                                    being my fault and I am a huge asshole. This girl is almost 20 by the way. It’s not
                                    like I am dealing with an eight-year-old here (I do wonder about the mentality of
                                    the girl though, I want to ask if she is handicapped and I was just never told, but
                                    that wouldn’t go over well). Anyways, this is going to be my life for the next year
                                    (At least). On the plus side, if I just stop caring, then it is possible that I may
                                    get a lot more work done. This is because I won’t be able to go upstairs and be
                                    around them without totally freaking out. Something I am not sure if I have ever
                                    told you before. My very biggest pet peeve in the entire freaking world is
                                    ignorance. I don’t mean that in a way that’s like I hate all mentally handicapped
                                    people or anything. I mean that if someone has the capability to do something or
                                    the opportunity to learn how to do something or anything of that nature (Especially
                                    with common sense tasks or life skills that you will need in the future), and they
                                    choose to remain ignorant, even after I or someone else has offered or tried to
                                    show them. Then that person asks me to do that same thing for them again. I get
                                    mad. I will not help them. They had the opportunity to learn a basic life skill and
                                    didn’t want to, so I will not help that person. I am talking about basic knowledge
                                    here too. This girl put tin foil in the microwave when she was 18 because she
                                    didn’t know she couldn’t. People learn that when they are like 5. I watched this
                                    girl try to microwave raw chicken. This girl will light every candle in the house
                                    then leave the dogs out the FREAKNG LEAVE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWORDS, and I am the one
                                    who is saying stupid shit when I get mad about it. IT’S JUST SO FREAKING DUMB!
                                    Anyways, thank you for letting me vent. Depending on the mood I am in when I
                                    finally publish this, I may or may not take this stuff out. LOL, I have to sign off
                                    though. I will be back tomorrow.

                                <p>
                                    Good evening. Today was mu late day at work so I am just getting home and it is
                                    already 6:30 P.M. I woke early this morning though and actually got some very good
                                    time in on the website. I found out how to set up debugging and port forwarding
                                    through Google Dev Tools. That made it so I could plug my phone into the computer
                                    with a USB cable and actually see my website on the phone as I develop it. That is
                                    awesome. No matter how many responsive design and window resizing tools I have
                                    used, none of them seem to work that great. So, being able to actually do it on my
                                    phone is a huge help. Other than that I didn’t get a whole lot done today so far. I
                                    have been re going over the 5WH of HTML and re-writing it so that it looks and
                                    sounds a little better. So, I got a bit of that done today. It was busy today
                                    though, so I didn’t get much more done. I am off to go get started on it all now
                                    though.
                                </p>
                                <h4>August 18 and 19, 2018</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Sorry I didn’t check in yesterday. I got a lot done in the last 2 days though.
                                    Every time I get a bunch done I find more that I need to do though. I have been
                                    going back through and removing this black header background I had on all the pages
                                    because I realized that it is making everything act funny. I also realized I don’t
                                    need it because I can achieve the same thing with setting the background color of
                                    the h1 to black and then just using padding to stretch it. It has made a huge
                                    difference taking that off the pages. The only problem is that everything the
                                    background was messing up, I had to work around. Now that I am removing it, I have
                                    to go back through and fix all of that stuff again. It isn’t too tough though. I
                                    have all of it done except like 2 pages. In the last couple weeks, I feel like I
                                    have been learning a lot. I finally understand how the CSS preprocessor SASS works,
                                    which is awesome. Just a whole bunch of stuff has been clicking. I am excited to
                                    get this done, not just because it is finally done, but because I want to re-create
                                    it using all the new stuff I have been picking up. I am to the point though, where
                                    I think I would feel comfortable making websites for people. So long as they didn’t
                                    want to much JavaScript. That is definitely the next thing I am working on though.
                                    I understand some JavaScript, but I can’t really use it yet, if that makes any
                                    sense. Other than that, while I was at work I wrote a bunch more of the final draft
                                    of the 5WH of HTML, and that is coming along very nicely. If I remember right, I
                                    only have to list some ways to learn HTML and finish writing about how it is used
                                    for accessibility. I have also been doing a bit of research on how to monetize the
                                    website once it is up. That is the only way I can justify to my girlfriend why I
                                    have spending so much time doing this. It doesn’t look like there is any actual
                                    quick way to do it though. Sure, Google AdWords will pay me, but that is per click.
                                    So, I would need to have plenty of traffic anyway, which I won’t have right away.
                                    On top of that, who actually clicks on advertisements. I know, I for one, never
                                    click on them, unless it is an accident. I hope she understands that. I need to
                                    keep making good content and play the long game and the monetization will happen
                                    organically. I figure there is really no way I won’t make any money off all this.
                                    It could take a while, but it will happen. I don’t remember the quote fully, but
                                    something about “Do what you love, and the money will follow”. I do love doing this
                                    too. Now that I have those time keeping applications, I know that I code for about
                                    40 hours a week. That is all after I work 40 hours a week. Then I also write
                                    content while I am at work. So really, I am putting in about 45 hours a week doing
                                    this. If I didn’t love it, then I would be trying to find excuses not to do it. It
                                    seems most of the time, I have to come up with excuses TO go and do this. I got to
                                    sign off though, as it is 10 P.M. and I have to go hang out with my old lady for a
                                    little bit. I’ll be back tomorrow. Goodnight.
                                </p>

                                    I’m sorry for not writing in here for so long. Honestly, I haven’t even really got
                                    much done. I had a big blow up with my girl the other night, so I have been trying
                                    to not smoke in the basement. Well, when I go outside and try to work, I have too
                                    many distractions. So, I have been stuck as far as that goes. I did get some
                                    writing done for my 5WH article on HTML, other than that though, not much else.
                                    Today was a bad day at work though, so I said screw it, I am smoking in here today.
                                    They can suck it up, because today is not the day to argue with me. I am going to
                                    go try to get some stuff done today, since I haven’t in so many days. I will try to
                                    check back in later.
                                </p>

                                    I promise I am not going to fall back into the habit of not writing in here every
                                    day. I am sorry I haven’t been keeping up with this, but I am in the home stretch
                                    of my website being done and I can smell the finish line. I finally started and
                                    finished my homepage. I think it looks the bet out of everything. The more pages
                                    and stuff I add, the more I want to go back and redo the whole thing though. I am
                                    so much better than when I first started, and I know I can make everything look and
                                    perform so much better. As I said, I am almost done. I don’t have the money to put
                                    it online yet, so if I get done and I have a lot of time to spare I am going to go
                                    ahead and redo it. I think I could quickly too. I am going to get to work though. I
                                    might be able to finish the main portion of it today actually.

                                    bull crap, but I was wrong. It is miserable out today. I am not leaving the
                                    basement for anything today. Oh! I have good news! I finished the major stuff for
                                    the website last night. All I have to do is go back through with my phone hooked up
                                    to it and tweak some things here and there, and the actual main content of the site
                                    is finished!! Awesome, right? I am going to go get to work on that though. Maybe I
                                    can be 100% done with it today.

                                    Sorry I haven’t been checking in much. I have good news though. I finished the main
                                    everything of the website!! As soon as I finished it you know what I did? I went
                                    back and started re-writing the whole thing LOL. My girlfriend was kind of pissed
                                    at me. One of my main goals is to get a job out of all this though. So, my code has
                                    to be done properly and look good. My code was neither. I’ll tell you what though,
                                    the difference between where I was when I started the web-site and where I am now
                                    is DRASTIC. Number 1, I am using SASS the right way, which I maybe did in like 2 or
                                    3 CSS stylesheets in my original code. Number 2, I can now make everything
                                    responsive much quicker and easier. Number 3, My new code looks about 10000 times
                                    better than my old jumbled mess. Number 4, I am doing everything so much faster. I
                                    just started re-doing my website last night and I already have it about halfway
                                    done. Number 5, there is a lot less code than I had originally. I was always trying
                                    to test stuff out or try to get things positioned how I wanted them and that code
                                    could get very long and sloppy. Now that I know how to do everything the right way,
                                    I cut most of my code in half (At Least). I am going to get a lot more of it done
                                    today I am sure. I wish I could get started on it now, but I woke up at 5 A.M. and
                                    decided to update and clean my computer before I got started. I started updating my
                                    Linux subsystem for Windows and it is still going. Oh it’s 10A.M. by the way, so it
                                    has been updating for at least 3 and a half hours. I can’t use my VS Code until it
                                    is done because my project runs through the Linux subsystem. So, I have been just
                                    kind of farting around waiting for it to finish. I tried creating a custom VS Code
                                    color theme. That turned out just awful. I think I am going to try to get some more
                                    of the 5WH typed up while I am waiting though. So, I will check back in later.

                                    Just got home from work. I’ll tell you what, I am getting super tired of being
                                    totally broke all the time, but always be working. My boss has had my evaluation
                                    sitting on his desk for 2 months and hasn’t so much as picked it up. He needs to do
                                    it, and fat, so I can see if they are going to give me the raise they promised. If
                                    they don’t then I am going to be forced to look for work elsewhere because I make
                                    peanuts right now and my house payment is 1,350 dollars a month. So, I am
                                    constantly broke. Anyways, I got a few more pages done the right way yesterday. The
                                    speed at which I can do all of it now is just awesome. I am doing in a week what
                                    took me like 4 months to accomplish. That is pretty awesome. I guess though, I
                                    don’t have to worry about design as much since, for the most part, it is already
                                    done, and I am just going back and doing it all the right way. I am just amazed
                                    though, at how much better I am at it. I am going to get to work though. I’ll try
                                    to check back in later.
                                </p>

                                    Finally, home from work. It felt like a long day. It was one of those days that I
                                    stayed extremely busy all day, but for whatever reason time still moved by slow. I
                                    am home now though and have 3 days off in a row. It is going to be wonderful, as
                                    long as I don’t get nagged into doing a bunch of crap I don’t want to do, which
                                    realistically, is probably going to happen. I did get quite a bit of writing done
                                    at work today. I have now finished the final drafts of the 5WH of HTML, CSS, and
                                    JavaScript. I started on the final draft of the Ruby one too. There’s a good chance
                                    I get most of that typed out this weekend because the final draft of my website is
                                    almost done as well. I think I have a few of the tutorials pages left, which now
                                    that I am doing everything the right way, is simple, because all the tutorials
                                    pages have the same design, so it’s basically just copying and pasting it. Then I
                                    have my about page, which is very simple, and then the one that might take me
                                    awhile, which is the contact page. Oh! I forgot to mention, I added this sweet
                                    looking background gradient animation to my tutorials page. I hope its not too
                                    much. I figure the Tutorials home page is basically just a big navigation menu, so
                                    it shouldn’t be distracting. I wouldn’t put it on a page where someone need to read
                                    and focus, but on that page, it looks pretty awesome. I am going to get to work
                                    though. I will try to check back in later. It is 10 P.M. and I am done for the
                                    night. I got 3 more of the tutorial pages done. I have 2 more and the tools section
                                    left. I am getting tired though. So, I am going to go upstairs and hang out with my
                                    girlfriend. We started watching this show that looks like it is going to be pretty
                                    awesome, called Castle Rock. As far as I can tell it is going to be a mishmash of
                                    Stephan King books. So, off I go to do that. I will see you almost certainly super
                                    early in the morning since I can't sleep in anymore. Goodnight.

                                    Sorry I didn’t check in for my entire long weekend. I had the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd off
                                    and just went back to work today. It was for Labor Day. I didn’t check in for good
                                    reason though. I worked my butt off to get the website done this weekend. I, no
                                    lie, put in about 32 hours of work on stuff for the site in just those 3 days. I
                                    GOT A ASS TON DONE!!! It’s actually finished, I just changed one of my main fonts
                                    today and it messed up, as far as I can tell, 1 page. So, all I have to do to be
                                    finished is change the margin-top on 2 paragraphs and it will be finished. Since I
                                    don’t have enough money to really finish it (Since it’s not truly finished until it
                                    is live online) I am going to read up on some of the more technical stuff like how
                                    to cache everything myself, maybe toy around with a comments section, write out
                                    some more of the “Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How’s of Programming”(Because I
                                    want to be ready to release one 1 week after I am up and going and then I want to
                                    release something at least once a week until, hopefully the site starts to really
                                    catch on). Sorry, I am being yelled at to come inside, so I got to go. Goodnight.

                                    My neighbors saint tree fell on his garage last night and knocked out the power to
                                    the houses around him along with it. My battery is about to die as well. I am so
                                    tired and miserable right now. I am going to go into work early. Hah I was trying
                                    to go ahead and type this morning, but I was so tired. I am home from work now
                                    though. I am super freaking tired. That tree fell on my neighbors’ garage and you
                                    would have thought a plane crashed in my backyard. The power is back though, thang
                                    god for that. Anyways, in the last few days I have been doing just tweaking to the
                                    website, since it is pretty much done. I added meta descriptions and titles and a
                                    few other things that google told me to do. I have to make some more tweaks now.
                                    I’ll check back in more than likely not tonight, but I will for sure tomorrow.

                                    Just got home from work. I didn’t get a whole lot done as far as the site goes, but
                                    that's because at this point, everything I am doing is new and I still have to
                                    learn it. So I did do a bit of experimenting and research. I am trying to figure
                                    out how the Ruby on Rails asset pipeline works. I want my website to only load the
                                    fonts it needs on that particular page, as opposed to all of them for every page
                                    whether the page needs them or not. I have to figure out a bunch more stuff to
                                    optimize it too. All the technical stuff really. It’s awesome though, because I
                                    love learning new things. I don’t have the cash to make it live yet either. I won’t
                                    for a while unfortunately. I have to pay my step-father back 300 out of this check
                                    and then next check I have to pay to get car insurance and register my tabs for my
                                    car. Maybe I can talk one of my parents into an early Christmas gift LOL. I am not
                                    counting on that though. It’s time to get to work. I have to go to my dads in about
                                    20 minutes, but after that I don’t think I have any plans and should be able to
                                    figure some stuff out. OH! I forgot to mention, that I do still have some stuff
                                    dealing with views left to do, because I finished my first Who, What, When, Where,
                                    Why, and How,s of programming article last night. It’s about HTML, and I think it
                                    turned out pretty alright. Anyways, off to work I go.

                                <p>
                                    Just got home from work. It wasn’t very busy today, so I managed to write an entire
                                    Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How’s of Programming article. This one was about
                                    Python. I actually finished that one and started on another one for GitHub.
                                    Anyways, I have not gotten a whole lot done the last few days, but only because I
                                    am in new territory, so I am having to do a lot of experimenting and such. I have
                                    been styling the 5WH of HTML as well and that is almost done. I am getting confused
                                    by stuff with this portion of the website. Google tells me to write inline CSS
                                    above the fold for page load times, while everything I have been taught to this
                                    point says DO NOT write your CSS inline as it makes everything messy and hard to
                                    understand. I think I know what Google is really trying to tell me to do though,
                                    but I am not 100% sure. I think it wants me, not to actually put my CSS inline, but
                                    to put the above the fold CSS in style tags in the head of the document. Also,
                                    another thing that is confusing me is still the Rails Asset Pipeline. If I need to
                                    put separate thing in the head of my web-pages Rails wants me to do a boat load of
                                    extra stuff. It would be easier to just not use the asset pipeline, which is an
                                    option. I know that I am missing something though. Rails wouldn’t be so popular if
                                    it was as big a mess as I am making it LOL. I am getting there though. As I have
                                    said before, it is night and day from where I am now to where I was. I just need
                                    that “Click” moment to happen. When all of a sudden everything in Rails will make
                                    sense to me. It has happened with everything else I have tried to learn to this
                                    point, so I don’t see why it wouldn’t happen with Rails as well. What I am
                                    especially having trouble with is the preload attribute in Rails. Everything,
                                    everywhere, is telling me to preload my assets. Well, IM TRYING!! Rails won’t let
                                    me, and it is starting to piss me off. Oh! I went to my dad’s house the other day,
                                    and I had sent him the link to my web-site and he got his first look at it. He is
                                    the first person that I actually believe what they say about it. My dad is nice and
                                    all but he isn’t going to sugarcoat anything and he is going to tell you exactly
                                    what he thinks. Well, he was impressed, more-so by my writing ability, but
                                    impressed nonetheless. He actually started digging out Readers Digest to find where
                                    it says to submit work and stuff because he thinks I should actually be trying to
                                    freelance as a writer. I have looked into that and it is definitely something I am
                                    considering. I want to only submit some work that I have written for my web-site
                                    though. Maybe on other tech sites. That way my name can get out there and it will
                                    drive more traffic to my site. Let’s see… What else.. I proofread my entire site
                                    yesterday and ran it all through a spell checker, so that's all fixed and done. I
                                    didn’t do the Daily Grind section, just because there is so much there, and it is
                                    supposed to be like a journal anyways, not a professional piece of writing. I am
                                    off to work though. I probably won’t check back in today so, Goodnight, even though
                                    it is only 5 in the afternoon. I am back, just for a minute though. I was going to
                                    watch the end of the Detroit Lions games, but I saw the score… The Jets are
                                    supposed to be one of the worst teams in the league this year and their hammering
                                    us (with a friggin rookie quarterback), and hammering us bad… It’s 48 to 13 in the
                                    4th… Anyways, I completed my very first actual tutorial for the website. I found a
                                    few new tools in that are pretty awesome in the process too. First, I switched back
                                    to regular Visual Studio Code from the User Setup Insiders Edition, which was
                                    getting very laggy and buggy for some reason. This was a good choice. I hadn’t
                                    realized how bad the Insiders one had gotten till I switched back. Everything
                                    started being so smooth, so that was nice. Then I decided I needed a new snipping
                                    tool for screen-shots and found ShareX. This thing does all sorts of crap that I
                                    would list now if it weren’t for the fact that I am currently being yelled at to
                                    get off the computer. I’ll be back in the morning. Goodnight.

                                    Sorry I havent been keeping up with this. I ended up finally getting web hosting a
                                    few days ago. I don’t have a lot of money, so I had to go for an unmanaged account
                                    (Oh, and because I built my site with Ruby on Rails I had to get a Virtual Private
                                    Server, which is more money.). I knew it would be difficult, but not this
                                    difficult. I am totally lost. I have already had to reset my entire server and re
                                    install the OS back on it. This morning I might actually be getting some stuff
                                    done, but I can’t stare at it any longer. It’s one thing if I am making progress,
                                    then I can sit here for weeks and just keep going. If I am not making any progress
                                    whatsoever and am basically just running my head into a wall over and over again by
                                    being told to input the same commands into my terminal over and over again, then I
                                    get pretty flustered by day 3 apparently. I have talked to customer support from
                                    both NameCheap and Comodo this morning though, and I think I am starting to get
                                    somewhere. Unfortunately I just had to have NameCheap fix my DNS again, so that is
                                    going to take awhile before it is all ready. In the mean time, I suppose I could go
                                    work on the actual site. I just don’t know though, because if I can’t get this crap
                                    figured out I am going to end up having to remake my site without using Rails so I
                                    can just put it on regular shared hosting. I was sort of shocked when I learned
                                    that Rails couldn’t be used on regular shared hosting. That just isn’t a question
                                    that I would have thought to have asked before starting with it. Oh well though,
                                    you live and learn. I just know I have to get this stuff figured out this weekend,
                                    or I have to ask for my money back and then just completely remake the site….
                                    again.

                                    I’m sorry! I really am!! I promise I will start writing daily again. It’s because I
                                    have been so busy with finally getting everything running live online. With https
                                    by default!! That stupid shit that was pissing me off so bad, on Heroku (Which I
                                    don’t know why I didn’t think of sooner) I pretty much just had to sign up for
                                    their hobby plan (7 dollars a month), and then pretty much run 2 or 3 commands
                                    (Which I will wright about in the blog) and it was up and going, live. So, ever
                                    since I have gotten the site live, I have been spending every minute doing the
                                    stuff I need to do to get it found. Things like submitting site maps, getting the
                                    site submitted to all the different search engine, signing up and CloudFlare going,
                                    and a butt load of other stuff.

                                    Sorry I got off of here so abruptly last night. I bet you can’t guess why I did?
                                    HAH. Of course you can. Because I was being yelled at. Anywho, my girlfriend was
                                    moving around like crazy last night, so I ended up waking up at friggin 5:30 A.M.
                                    and coming out here to work on stuff. Even though I have been out here all day, I
                                    have barely gotten anything done. It is probably because I am trying to work on
                                    something new. Just something that won’t take me very long, once I have the design
                                    worked out. That is my portfolio page. I had a good idea for it last night and I
                                    didn’t want to forget or anything, so I knew I had to get it started before I did.
                                    It’s basically making fun of all the portfolios I have seen. There’s a boat load of
                                    portfolio sites that say things like “Just a developer, trying to change the world”
                                    or “A developer trying to make the world a better place”. What I did is say “Hi.
                                    I’m Kenneth Olsen, and I want to change the world through web development”, then it
                                    says “I want to cure world hunger through coding”, and then finally it says “I want
                                    to cure the common cold with websites”. HAH. Then I took the Liam Neeson speech
                                    from the movie Taken and re-did it. I don’t remember it word for word right now but
                                    it is something along the lines of “I don’t know who you are. I don’t know what you
                                    want. If you want someone with a CS degree, I don’t have it. What I do have, is a
                                    particular set of skills that I have gained over a long career. If you don’t
                                    contact me now, then I wont find you and I will pursue my dream elsewhere. If you
                                    do contact me, then I will find you, I will bring you a coffee, and I will sit down
                                    with you for a formal interview.” I think it was pretty funny and creative. After
                                    that I am going to list how my career as a maintenance man has given me skills that
                                    actually translate well to web development. Such as being able to communicate with
                                    someone that might not understand what I am talking about very well (Because I work
                                    at a nursing home that specializes in Alzheimer and Dementia), empathy, thinking
                                    outside the box (you’d be surprised at how often you have to figure out a way to
                                    talk a resident into letting you come in and fix what needs to be fixed. I mean, I
                                    understand, though. If I was confused as all heck, didn’t really know what was
                                    going on or where I am, and only knew that this is my sleeping area, I would be
                                    leery of letting anyone come in too.)

                                    Sorry I haven’t checked in again. It’s just been one hell of a stressful week. It
                                    started with my car. I have had some cars that the brakes went out, but with enough
                                    distance and pressing on the brake hard enough it would eventually stop. Well not
                                    this time. I had the scariest drive to work in my life a few days ago. My brakes
                                    were totally gone. I had to run 2 red lights, almost got in a crash, and actually
                                    just coasted right by the parking lot to my work. I just got home from work. Now I
                                    will complete the story I was telling you earlier. Then, once at work, one of my
                                    coworkers has decided that he is above doing the daily tasks like taking out the
                                    garbage, so that all falls onto me. I was off the last 2 days and since I was not
                                    there, this coworker still decided not to do the garbage, so I was stuck with 4
                                    dumpsters full of garbage this morning I had to take out. Then my girlfriends
                                    stupid daughter has a stupid girlfriend, that no one has ever met, flying up from
                                    Florida and staying here for the week. This makes my girlfriend very uncomfortable,
                                    but I am the bad guy for saying that I don’t like it. I don’t care that she is gay,
                                    I just made a rule a long time ago that on days that I have to work, she can’t have
                                    friends stay the night. Do you know how many times that rule has been listened too?
                                    If you guessed 1 time…. You would be wrong. It has never been listened to. That is
                                    because my girl can’t say no to her daughter for whatever reason. I know a lot of
                                    people say that, but this is legit. I say that I want something to be done or stop
                                    being done and my girlfriend says “I’m not going to tell her that, I will just do
                                    it myself.” That is what happens literally every single time. I have a lot of
                                    stories about the extreme lengths my girlfriend will go to in order to not have to
                                    tell her daughter to do something. She thinks she’s helping her, but she is not.
                                    This girl doesn't know how to do anything. She is almost 20 and doesn't know she
                                    can’t put foil in the microwave, she uses A HALF A BOTTLE of dish soap when she
                                    does the dishes, she thought she could take 3 of her prescription pills at once
                                    because the bottle said “Take up to 3 times a day as needed”. I once watched her
                                    microwave ray chicken. It is legitimatly scary that she is almost 20 and doesn’t
                                    know any of these things. Then her mom goes and rewards her for the stupidity
                                    constantly. That will make my head explode one day. Trust me when I say that is not
                                    even the half of it either. I swear to you EVERY SINGLE DAY when I get home I
                                    realize that the girl has done the stupidest thing I have ever seen in my life.
                                    That means she tops herself every day. Anyways, on top of that, my phone died on
                                    me, that was just to top it all off. There is a bunch more stuff that happened in
                                    that short few days too, but it would take 10 more pages to list it all. I am home
                                    now though. In a little bit I have to go get my dads car, so I have something to
                                    drive for the rest of the week. As far as my website and everything goes, I haven’t
                                    had the chance to get a whole lot more done. Last night I did start adding some
                                    more HTML tools to the tools page. Then I did a bit of work on my portfolio. I am
                                    going to try to get some work in now though, so I will talk to you later. Unless my
                                    head explodes.

                                    Home for lunch. Things have started to get a little better. My dad is letting me
                                    use his car, all the way till the end of April, if I need to. Than I just got my
                                    crappy little prepaid phone turned back on, so at least I can place calls again.
                                    Other than that, my day has been pretty crappy. Anyways, last night I added a bit
                                    more content to the website. I figure if I add at least a little bit everyday, than
                                    hopefully I will crawl up the Google rankings. 2 days ago I added an HTML tools
                                    section to it. HTML doesn’t have a whole lot of tools though. Basically just
                                    WYSIWYG editors and minifiers. Than last night I added a CSS tools section. There
                                    are a crap load of CSS tools, so I am going to add a nice list of some, and then
                                    every Tuesday I am going to add 3 more. That way people will have a reason to keep
                                    coming back. As far as the CSS tools I have already added, it’s just color pickers,
                                    so far. I listed 3 different types, a plain one, an HSL picker, and a downloadable
                                    one that is a bit more advanced. Tonight I am going to do CSS gradient generators,
                                    then tomorrow I am going to do color palette generators. This is all under a
                                    “Colors” section. I am going to have a few different section for CSS. After colors,
                                    I am going to do animation generators, frameworks, Grids and flexbox, and whatever
                                    other things I can’t think of right now. Like I said though, I am going to release
                                    new CSS stuff every week. So, after I get done with the colors section, I am going
                                    to move on to JavaScript tools. JavaScript has probably 100 times more tools than
                                    CSS even, so that will be another one that I release weekly. I need to think of
                                    some more original content for the blog and finish the “Who, What, Where, When,
                                    Why, and How’s of CSS” as well. Than I already have the 5wh of JavaScript, Ruby,
                                    Ruby on Rails, and Python written out on paper as well. So, those need to get typed
                                    up to. This is sure going to be a lot of work. I know that I love doing it, but I
                                    hope it pays off somehow too. The amount of time I have already dedicated to it has
                                    got to be getting close to 1000 hours at this point and the time I am going to be
                                    dedicating to it is going to bring me into the 10 of thousands, I am sure. So, it
                                    would be nice to be able to justify that amount of time spent to my girlfriend, my
                                    mom, my dad, my sister, and myself with at least a small payday. Also, I am
                                    starting to get desperate to get out of my current job. I am beyond miserable there
                                    and I would love to be able to get into the development field somehow. I am going
                                    to just be desperate pretty soon and start E-mailing companies and asking if they
                                    need a maintenance man that they could pay pretty cheaply in exchange for the
                                    opportunity to learn and grow into a developer roll. There has got to be some
                                    companies out there that would take me up on that offer. As a matter of fact, I am
                                    going to work on a letter to companies today. I need to think of what to put in the
                                    letter. I will tell them my situation, why I want to get into their company, I need
                                    to personalize it for them, list my skills as a maintenance person and how those
                                    skills can translate in to development. I just need to convince them that what I am
                                    offering is too good to pass up. Really, it is a good deal for them. Pay me 15
                                    dollars an hour and I will come in and handle all their maintenance. So, all of
                                    their painting, plumbing, drywall, electrical, etc. Also, they will be getting
                                    someone that wants to learn, will put the time in to learn, and will be extremely
                                    grateful for getting an opportunity. I got to get going back to work though, so I
                                    am going to work on that whenever I get a chance, for the rest of the day.
                                    Hopefully I will have a pretty good letter by the end of work that I can start
                                    sending out to companies. I wish I could just apply to be a developer now, but I
                                    know that I am not there yet. I do have all the “soft skills” they would need
                                    though. Like being able to communicate with customers in a way they would
                                    understand and such. Anyways, I got to go. I will see you later. It’s 10 P.M. and I
                                    am about to sign off for the night, but I wanted to check in first. So, I got my
                                    letter written, I think it turned out pretty good too. I almost think that whoever
                                    reads it will almost feel guilty about themselves if they don’t at least contact
                                    me. I only told the truth in it though. I went through why I want to work for them,
                                    what I have been doing for the last 10 years, how I’m qualified (and how I am not
                                    qualified, like I said, I was being totally honest), the skills that I can bring to
                                    them as a maintenance man, the skills that I believe would translate well from what
                                    I do now to what I want to be doing for them, and a few other things. It was a long
                                    E-Mail, which I apologized for, but it was a good E-Mail. I think, if nothing else,
                                    that I will at least get a couple of replies to this one. The other ones I have
                                    made were sort of hastily put together and didn’t really explain what I brought to
                                    the table. This one is very clear and I think I sell myself pretty well. I don’t
                                    really want to send it out quite yet though, because I think I still have a bit
                                    more work to do on my website (which I sent them the link too. I hope that won’t be
                                    a mistake.), but once I get just a bit more content and double check for any and
                                    all errors, I will be ready to send it. You don’t have any idea how happy I would
                                    be if I even got an interview from it. To me, that would be a foot in the door.
                                    They would be interviewing me knowing that I am not experienced, so they would most
                                    likely be going into the interview knowing they are not going to hire me right
                                    then. I know I can sell myself well enough in an interview to at least be kept in
                                    consideration when I gain a bit more skill. Other than that, I knocked out a bit
                                    more of the CSS Tools on my website. I added 3 color generators along with links
                                    and images and a good paragraph explaining them. I am happy about that too. It was
                                    taking me hours to finish something like that just a couple weeks ago, now I am
                                    knocking it out in a half hour. With no lack in the design or presentation either.
                                    I have to get inside and get ready for bed though. So, I will talk to you tomorrow.
                                    Goodnight.

                                    Home for lunch. I don’t know why, but I have been ridiculously tired for like 2
                                    weeks. Every day I feel like I sleep all day. I think it’s stress. All the stuff
                                    with my girlfriends daughter and work and just everything. Oh well, what are ya
                                    gonna do? Know what I mean? Anyways, since I have been home for lunch I submitted
                                    my site to the Bing search engine and ran some SEO tests. I need to figure out how
                                    to get my site to rank higher, because I have no idea where it is in the Google
                                    rankings. Maybe later I will sit down and try to figure that out. Most of the page
                                    speed tests and SEO tests give my site an A grade, so I don’t know why it doesnt
                                    rank at all. It is probably something I messed up somewhere while submitting my
                                    site. I need to start keeping a TO DO list too. Because I want to start adding
                                    something like a banner or a star on links to certain pages where I have put
                                    updated content. I only want to keep that on there for like a week though, so if I
                                    don’t set myself some sort of reminder,I know I will end up forgetting about it and
                                    leaving some of them up for way to long. The rest of the day at work, I am going to
                                    make that TO DO list whenever I have a break. There is so much crap you have to
                                    remember to do. I have an extremely good memory, but I forget sometimes too. Well,
                                    it’s time to get back to Hell. I really hate going to this place. That, I am sure,
                                    is a big part of my stress. That’s a problem in my family. My sister and I both
                                    stress way to much. It’s because of my mom. (Sorry mom, it’s true though. You know
                                    I still love you though.) My dad doesn’t seem to stress about anything, so it has
                                    got to be from her. Here I go, wasting time so I don’t have to go back right away.
                                    I am really leaving this time though. I will talk to you later. Home from work. I
                                    don’t know how anyone can stand it in my house right now. It smells freaking
                                    intensely of pumpkin. Really, my girls daughter isn’t even allowed to light
                                    candles. She can’t be trusted with fire, so awhile back we made that rule. It was
                                    promptly broken and if I tried to say anything then it’s me who is the bad guy.
                                    I’ll tell you what, I really have to pick and choose my battles with her and her
                                    daughter. She switches into mom mode and it doesn’t matter what anyone says, shes
                                    right and they are wrong, even if her argument makes absolutely no sense. It’s
                                    pretty ridiculous. Anyways, I made my little TO DO list and started on adding some
                                    keywords to my site. It will take a long time to do all of that though, so I am
                                    just going to do a little bit everyday. Also, I was wondering why no matter what I
                                    can’t find my page in the Google search results and I found out that for the first
                                    90 days Google might not even make my site available because it wants to make sure
                                    their is no fishy activity coming from my website and that the content is up to
                                    par. So, the advice I read, is to just try to add quality content everyday and
                                    after the 90 days I could get placed pretty high. We will see, but I am going to go
                                    get to work. I am done with the website for tonight. I added a color palette
                                    generator section to the website and started on a color theory section. I actually
                                    am thinking maybe I will do a color theory tutorial myself. Mainly because I
                                    wouldn't mind learning about it too. I am going to try to get a little work done on
                                    my portfolio site though, and I probably won't be checking back in tonight. So,
                                    Have a Goodnight.

                                    Today felt like an extremely long day. I have been so stressed out over everything
                                    at home that I have felt sick to my stomach and tired non-stop. The other girl is
                                    finally gone though, and SURPRISE, her daughter is back to acting normal again.
                                    Well, not normal, but you know what I mean. For the last couple of days, when I
                                    haven't been feeling sick, I have been working on a new page/section for the site.
                                    It's a Tech News page, and it just reads off of a few sites RSS. I have DZone,
                                    HowToGeek, Hacker News, and Tech Radar all constantly updating and scrolling on the
                                    page. I am almost done with it, but I still need to make it responsive before I add
                                    it to the site. I have been thinking more about getting into writing too. I know I
                                    have the talent to do it, but I am unsure if I would be able to fill a book, and
                                    that's what I am being told to try to write. If I did, I would probably base it off
                                    of my life. There are things that I don't really want certain people to know about
                                    though, but I definitly think I could do it. I could try my hand at fiction too. I
                                    have a good story in me that I actually wrote when I was in like 6th grade, but it
                                    would be very topical, has some good charchters, and a nice twist ending. I would
                                    obviosly have to flesh it out, but for being in 6th grade it was a great idea. It
                                    was a story about some kids that lead a pretty normal life, but 1 of them gets sick
                                    and dies. His death was caused by pollution and global warming and the like. I
                                    don't remember all of it but I have it around here somewhere. I know the ending was
                                    that they weren't on Earth, but Earth was still what was causing it all somehow.
                                    Like I said, it would have to be fleshed out and re-done, but the general premise
                                    is solid. I love the idea of writing about my life, but as I said, I was not always
                                    an upstanding citizen and there are things that I would rather not let some people
                                    know. The problem is, that those parts are the good parts. I have had nights that
                                    are more comedic and intense than the night in the movie "SuperBad". I have had
                                    weeks where every night was like that. Honestly, if my life during that time were
                                    turned into a movie, I would definitly watch it. Anyways, I don't have work
                                    tomorow, so as long as I am feeling better I plan on getting quite a few things
                                    done to the site. For tonight I am signing off though. Goodnight.

                                    I'm home for lunch. I barely slept last night. My girlfriend got up at like 4:30
                                    A.M. and ran into a door and scared the hell out of me, and once my heart gets
                                    pumping from that, there is just no going back to sleep for me. Anyways, I got the
                                    Tech News page done yesterday. I had to use a wierd workaround because for whatever
                                    reason the RSS fedds would'nt show unless you manually refreshed the page. So, I
                                    just made a JavaScript button that you have to click and it refreshes the page and
                                    shows all the news. Other than that, I have not gotten a whole lot done. I don't
                                    know why, but I have been intensly tired for the past week and just haven't felt
                                    like doing much. I am still getting things done, but not nearly as much as I would
                                    like. Oh well, it will come back to me. I just need to relax and get some and don't
                                    push myself too hard for a little while and I will be back to normal. I was looking
                                    at some other tutorials too. I need to keep learning and not only focus on the
                                    website or I will never level up my skills. I kind of am hitting a wall again,
                                    where I am unsure of my skills and feel far behind where I should be. Yeah, I am
                                    pretty confident with myself and building static sites, but where is that going to
                                    get me in todays age? I need to get back into learning JavaScript and either start
                                    back on Python or Ruby. Maybe take a look at Elixir too. I was playing around a
                                    little bit with it the other day and it seems pretty interesting. Oh! On a side
                                    note, I switched my code editor. VS Code started setting off my anti-virus for some
                                    reason and started getting all glitchy. I was going to just re-install it, but
                                    decided to check out Atom from GitHub. I must say that I like it so far. Its
                                    functionally the same as VS Code, but it seems to do everything a bit faster. I'm
                                    sure it's because of the amounty of extensions I had installed, but it's nice to
                                    explore some different options. I do like it so far, so I am going to stick with it
                                    for awhile. So far today I just fixed that button for the Tech News and wrote this.
                                    I don't know how much gas I will have left in the tank when I get home, but at
                                    least something got accomplished. It's about time to head back to work though, so I
                                    will talk to you later. It's almost 8 P.M. now. I got the HTML Tools page done and
                                    live, and fixed the stylesheets for the tools section. I was making seperate sheets
                                    for each tools page, but then I realized that all I am really doing is moving all
                                    the info from the main Tools page to another page and the rules on that stylesheet
                                    still apply. So, that simplified everything a bit. Actually, that is going to make
                                    it super easy to make all the tools pages, so that's cool. I just got done cutting
                                    the grass, then I gotta run to Miejer and pick up the dogs prescription, and then I
                                    have to cook dinner (Sloppy Joes!!). So, I doubt I will be back tonight. Also, I am
                                    installing the newest Windows Creators Update. The last time I did that my computer
                                    was down for 3 days, so crossing my fingers that doesnt happen again, but that also
                                    means I probably won't be back tonight. Tomorow, hopefully I get done the CSS tools
                                    page and then I can start back up on the CSS tools. Then I get to move on to
                                    JavaScript tools. There is probably 1,000,000,000 of those, so that will keep me
                                    busy for awhile. Anyways, off I go to the store, so I will talk to you tomorow
                                    (Unless Microsoft breaks my computer again.). Goodnight.

                                <p>
                                    I did the big new Windows update last night. When I came home from lunch my
                                    computer wouldn't turn on, needless to say I started to freak out. I did a bit of
                                    fiddling with everything and got it up and going though. One thing I hate, and I
                                    hope it does the same as last time, is that after every one of these big updates my
                                    computer runs slow for like a week. I already checked all the drivers and their all
                                    up to date, so I don't know why it does that. Hopefully it works itself out though,
                                    because there is nothing more annoying than lag. Anyways, since I have been home
                                    from work, I got the CSS Tools page done and live, so now I am all caught up. I
                                    think I am going to work on some more tools for the CSS page and then go back and
                                    finsh the "Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How's of CSS". I really need to take a
                                    break from the website though, which I really don't want to do, and get back to
                                    learning some more. I will say, that I have learned way more since starting the
                                    website than I probably would have ever learned through tutorials, but my site has
                                    barely any JavaScript, which is a good thing, but not because I wanted to keep the
                                    JavaScript to a minimum, but because I don't know it very well. I really need to
                                    get back to learning programming in general, because as of right now I would be
                                    more of a designer that sort of knows how to code. That is not what I want to be.
                                    So, I think I am actuually going to do that for a little bit. I will tal to you
                                    later.
                                </p>

                                    So, for the last few days, my computer has been crashing like every half hour. It
                                    was just sort of aggravating at first, but then it crashed and deleted a whole
                                    bunch of stuff that I had been working on. It had crashed a few times before that
                                    while I was in the middle of something and when it rebooted, it had always gone
                                    right back to where I was. So I was slowly trying to figure out the problem by
                                    running various tests throughout the day. Well, after it deleted all of my work, I
                                    had to figure it out. I did to. It was somehow an old installation of Microsoft
                                    Visual Studio that was doing it. I thought I had uninstalled everything, but
                                    apparently there were some residual files hanging out, and one of them was causing
                                    it. Don't ask me, computers work in mysterious ways sometimes. Anyways, I got that
                                    figured out, but before I had figured that out, Atom had started slowing down
                                    (Which in retrospect was, I'm sure, because of the crashing). So, I decided to test
                                    out Sublime Text and Brackets. Now, I had tested them out before, but I never
                                    really gave them a fair shot. Thiis time I did and afterwords I went right back to
                                    Visual Studio Code. Honestly, the other editors don't hold a flame to VS Code, and
                                    after I figured out the issue with my computer, everything is running like it's
                                    brand spankin new. So, I am pretty happy about that. I also fixed my tech news page
                                    (hopefully). For the D-Zone RSS feed it had been stuck on Tuesday, when I put it
                                    in. So, I just got rid of D-Zone and put in "The Next Web". I don't like them quite
                                    as much as D-Zone, but it's an alright alternative. I also got the images that come
                                    along with the RSS feeds to start working, so those are on there now. Let's see, I
                                    also got a bit more done with the "Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How's of CSS".
                                    I would have had a lot more of it done, but my computer crashed and erased it all.
                                    Oh, and last night I finally added the "Color Theory" section to CSS Tools. Then,
                                    just a few minutes ago, I added the New Relic monitoring service to my Gemfile and
                                    to my Heroku dashboard. I don;t have many visitors yet, but once I do (fingers
                                    crossed) that will come in very handy apparently. I don't really know what all it
                                    does yet, actually. It is just super highly recomended, and even Heroku sent me an
                                    e-mail saying to maybe think about adding it. So I did. I'll check it all out again
                                    tomorow and see what it does exactly and if I got any more visitors to the site. I
                                    don't really blame people for not sticking around on the site. It doesn't offer a
                                    whole lot yet. Hopefully, after I knock out some more 5WH of Programming, people
                                    will start visiting more. I think that and the tools section are going to end up
                                    being my selling points. After I get a bit more expierience the blog could turn
                                    into something too. My first piece is pretty good, at least that's what I think and
                                    my family and friends say. I could take what they say with a grain of salt, but
                                    when my dad actually says it, then it's probably true. He is not the type to give
                                    out compliments for no reason. I probably won't get any more work done tonight. I
                                    have to go spend some time with my girl, because she is starting to get upset
                                    again. I'll be back at it tomorow, more than likely bright and early, and I plan on
                                    getting the 5WH of CSS done. Then, if I do, maybe get started on the 5WH of
                                    JavaScript. I gotta make a JavaScript tools page too. As I said before, I probably
                                    could turn the entire website into just JavaScript tools and it would do well, just
                                    because there are so many. I know I have said it 1,000 times before, but I really
                                    hope someting comes out of all this work. I mean, learning a new skill is great,
                                    and I love to learn, but this is what I want to do all the time. So, I hope I can
                                    turn it into that. I gotta go though, I will talk to you in the morning. Goodnight.

                                    Well, I didn't get done what I said I was going to get done last night, but I did get a lot accomplished today.  For the majority of the day I was working on the sites SEO.  I used 3 or 4 different tools to scan the website and point out things that needed doing, and I am proud to say that I am the proud owner of a 100/100 on Google/Lighthous's audit.  That's 100/100 for each thing, not just performance.  That is SEO, best practices, accessability, and performance.  So, that's pretty awesome.  There is still much work to be done with all of that though.  I am still not getting much in the way of organic search traffic, but it will come.  I need to just keep plugging away and it will get there.  I did get alot more of the "Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How's of CSS" typed up though, so that's good.  If I had strictlt been going off of what I had written, then it would already be done, but I always run into things that I need to be more descriptive about or explain better.  That means more research, which in turn means more time.  I want to make sure that all of the content I put out is great quality though, I will not accept garbage writing on my site.  I also went to my dad's house for a little bit today.  He has been a musician his whole life (he started playing drums when he was 8 and played in probably 100 bands) until about 10 years ago when he got diagnosed with Rhumetoid Arthritis, as well as a variet of other ailments and arthritisis.  HE KNOWS MUSIC THOUGH!!! and I am trying to get him to start a YouTube channel or a podcast to talk and teach music.  I think he would be great at it.  I think I almost have him convinced, and if I do get him convinced, my website is going to have to take a backseat while I help him get one of those things going.  I would still be getting my learning and experience in, it would just be for someone else and not my website.  Anyways, it's aalmost 10 o'clock, so I have to be getting off here soon.  Tomorow starts another week in hell.  When I get out of work tomorow I plan on getting the rest of the 5WH of CSS typed up and hopefully finished.  That will just be the typing part though.  I will still need to go back and do all the code snippets and the tutorial page, but that should only take a day or 2.  So, hopefully I will have that done by the end of the week and I can start on the JavaScript one.  I amm about to get yelled at though, so I gotta be going.  I will talk to ya'll tomorow.  Goodnight.

                                    Hello my friends, how are you?  It's almost time for bed for me.  I figured I would check in real fast though.  You want to know how crazy the weather is up here in Michigan?  Last week it was in the high 50's and low 60's, which is about average for October in Michigan.  Today...., The real temp was 84, but the feel like temperature (after you add in the horrible humidity Michigan gets) was in the upper 90's.  Ain't that just peachy?  I thought we were done with this crap, but nope.  Tonight isn't supposed to be much better either.  I don't think it's supposed to drop under 70.  BLAHH!!  Anyways, I got a bunch more of the 5WH of CSS typed up.  Actually, as far as typing it up it's about done, but I still need to add in the code snippets and style it.  Like I said yesterday, it should be done by the weekend.
                                </p>

                                    Sorry about leaving so abruptly last night, I had to run to the stoore and thhen my girl wanted to watch T.V.  I am feeling kind of crappy today, I really hope I am not coming down with something again.  It's because of where I work.  Nursing homes, especially Alzhiemer and Dementia ones, are covered in germs.  There is not much you can do to keep from getting sick.  I'll tell you what though, I am sick and tired of that place.  Today was another absolutly miserable day.  I really can't take it anymore.  I either have to get out of there or they have to pay me what I should be getting paid.  It's been 4 months and I still haven't gotten my evaluation.  It's really pissing me off.  Actually, I am thinking about writing a letter to the administrator and explaining my situation and what I need to happen.  If she says no, then at least I know where I stand and I can confidently look for a new job knowing all the bullshit my boss told me before was... well... bullshit.  Anyways, I finished typing up the 5WH of CSS and have started working on the snippets.  Than I have to do the tutorial and get it looking good and that will be all set.  If I am coming down with something, I might not get it finished by the weekend like I thought, but progress is happening.  Instead of working onthat right now, though, I might write that letter I was talking about.  Actually, I am going to go do that now.  I probably won't be back tonight, so, Goodnight.

                                    Another miserable friggin day.  My co-worker and boss have this toxic relationship at work.  It's not toxic to them so much, but it sure is to me and my other co-worker.  It's just that my boss is like, honest to god, in love with this particular person, so when they are together, he has to show off or something and treat my one co-worker like garbage and me like I don't know how to do anything.  It is really one of the main reasons I want to quit there.  If they treated me like they do my one co-worker, Tim, then I would have done already quit, plus probably punched both in the nuts on the way out.  You want to know what the really messed up part of it is though?  That the toxic co-worker is actually the one that got me the job 8 years ago.  He is also one of my best friends outside of work.  I think that's crazy, that someone can be one way at work and then be totally different outside.  I friggin hate him at work, but outside we always have fun.  Anyways, I came home at lunch today and got a bit more of my CSS snippets done, and I am about to start working on the tutorial now.  I have about 2 hours to work, so I have to make it count.  I'll try to check back in later, but in case I don't, than have a good one.  Wait, one more thing, I want to try to think of a catchphrase for when I sign off of here and all that.  I'm tired of just saying goodnight.  I have no idea though.  How about "I'm signing off now so,  Wicky Wicky Splash Yo Yo Bang Bang"?  That pretty good?  HAH!  I don't know what I am doing LOL.  I'm going to go get some work done.

                                    I haven't got a whole lot of work done today.  I came home for lunch and did get a bit more of the 5WH of CSS done.  When I got home from work though, I started on the job hunt again.  I jusat can't take it being there much longer.  So I applied at about 6 places today.  I am sure that at least half will call me.  Then it will be up to me, what I want to do.  After I got done with applying for jobs I did get some work in.  I actually made this cool re-sizable iframe to show how media-queries work.  It lets the user drag it within my webpage to re-size the webpage with the webpage and changes some things.  I thought it was pretty cool and it's something new that I learned.  I apologize for my writing.  I know it's all choppy and doesn't flow at all today.  It's because I am still not really feeling good.  I know a lot of that has to do with stress from work though.  I'm about to sign off for the night and go get something to eat and relax for a bit so I will talk to you tomorow.<br>
                                    WICKY WICKY SPLASH YO YO BANG BANG!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br>
                                    HAH!!  Goodnight.

                                    I have spent all day since I got home from work, trying to figure out ways to make some money.  I ended up signing up for a survey site and so far have made 10 dollars, but I am done with it until I get my first payment.  I just want to know if it's legit before I waste all my time trying to do that.  It says it pays out on the 15th of every month and that is coming up next week, so we shall see.  Anyways, I came home for lunch today and got a bunch of the tutorial done for CSS.  I am going to work on it again right now.  It is almost done, so hopefully tomorow I will be able to style it and get it on the website.  I am going to go work on it though, so I will talk to you later.

                                Yesterday I was in a real funk.  All I was trying to do is write some stuff about frameworks to add to the Useful Tools page, but nothing was coming to me.  Usually I just flow with my writing, but as I said, yesterday was a real challenge.  I got some stuff done yesterday still though.  When I got up this morning, the funk had been lifted somewhat, soI got that finished and I fixed my Tech News page.  For some reason it was cutting everything off, so this morning I added a second page to it and it's working fine.  Since that stuff got done, I have been working a bit on my SEO.  Just trying to sprinkle in keywords here and there.  I think SEO is kind of stupid.  You shouldn't have to trick the browser into showing your page.  It should be enough to update frequently and have good content, but noooooo.  You have to do keyword research and all that crap.  It doesn't feel like actually doing development or anything.  It feels like what a baseball player in the MLB during the 90's would have had to of thought.  "Well everyone else is taking steroids and cheating, so in order to get paid I better do it too."  It's just dumb, but Oh Well.  I just wanted to check in really quick though, since I didn't yesterday.  Let you know that I have been working on it.  I don't have much longer to work tonight though, so I am going to get off of here and try to get a bit more work in, so Wicky Wicky Splash Yo Yo Bang Bang!!  I'll talk to you tomorow.  Goodnight.
