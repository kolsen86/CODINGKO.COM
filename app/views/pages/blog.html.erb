<p>When I first started learning programming, everytime I told someone I was learning to code I always received back “You understand that Matrix shit?” or, “Don’t you have to be a genius to understand all that gibberish?” .  The answers to those questions at the time was “No, I absolutely do not understand this Matrix shit.” and, “Yeah, I’m thinking you do have to be a genius to understand this stuff, because I have been staring at it for a month and it still looks like gibberish.”  Then I would go continue staring at the Matrix shit more while continuing to feel like I would never get it and wanting to punch my computer through a wall.
</p>
<p>Hello there, future programmer / developer!!  As this is my first ever, non-journal, piece of writing for codingko.com let me introduce myself.  My name is Kenneth Olsen, I am a coder, web developer, lover of technology, lover of sports, lover of life, lover of learning, and I also love to help others.  I believe that every single programmer in all of history and existence spent their first few months of learning staring at their computer screen, or abacus, or their holographic 3D wall (If you are reading this in the future.) and thought the same thing.  “This all looks like crazy gibberish.  How can anyone possibly understand this?  Let alone learn how to use this and manipulate machines with it.”  Well my friend, I am here to tell you that you absolutely can learn how to understand that gibberish and learn how to use it to make things do what you want them to do, and you don't even have to be a genius.  All you need is Passion, Patience, Persistence, Drive, and Determination.
</p>
<p>When I was growing up in the 1980’s and 1990’s personal home computers had just become a thing.  However, they were very expensive, and I came from the very epitome of a middle class family.  We didn’t struggle by any means, but luxuries like that expensive computer were far out of our reach.  The only piece of technology we owned in my household was a Nintendo Entertainment System.  Me, being much younger than my sister, was barely ever able to play with the Nintendo as my sister or dad were always on it.  My mother worked at K-Mart at the time and somehow lucked into a Commodore 16 from her work.  This was one of the first more affordable home computers (but still too expensive for our family to splurge on) and you may not believe this if you are under the age of 30, but it actually took cartridges!!  Back then there were very few programs that actually had a GUI (Graphical User Interface), so to get anything done with it required a whole lot of command line work.  So on rainy days, or when it was too late to go outside and play, little child me would head on down to the basement and play around on the Commodore (Because the Nintendo was occupied, Always.).  This is what started a passion for computers in my tiny child heart.  That passion only grew as I got older.  Instead of just computers I would take apart and fiddle with any electronics I could get my hands on.  By the time I was 11 or 12 I was helping a real computer company build computers and set up networks (It may have been my friend’s parents business, but I was still helping.)  I have kept that passion my entire life, even though it took me 30 years to finally decide to act on that passion, and try to turn it into a career.  A career that I would absolutely love to get up and go to every morning for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>I am guessing that you may be in the same boat I was, since you are reading this and all.  You may have decided long ago that you were going to act on your passion for technology and you’re already a seasoned programmer who just stumbled into codingko.com, and are now so enthralled with the story of the little boy with a passion for tech that you just have to stay and read the rest.  More than likely though, you are the guy from the beginning of this article, staring at the Matrix shit on your screen, getting ready to throw your  computer at the wall.  Maybe you are somewhere in between.  I would bet though, since you are looking for information on programming online that you have, at least some passion for trying to learn this stuff.  The hard part of it all is trying to keep that passion when everything starts breaking and you have no idea what to do, or how to fix it.  Here is some advice for trying to keep that passion alive and well.</p>

<p>    First let’s talk about what passion is.  Passion is defined as<i><strong> a strong and barely controllable emotion</strong></i>.  Wow!  Those are pretty strong words there.  Can anyone really feel that way towards a technology?  I can attest to the fact that “Yes” someone can feel like that toward technology.  I am an adult, with adult responsibilities.  A career in medical maintenance, a girlfriend that I live with, bills that need to get paid.  I can’t let learning a new skill get in the way of this stuff.  I am passionate about it though.  So, I spend every single break at work researching new ways to improve my web-site, or researching a coding issue I am having, or reading other programmers blogs.  When I am home you can almost always find me in my office, hacking away at one programming task or another until my girlfriend has to come yell at me to tell me what time it is or to get out there and spend time with her. (Sorry, Crystal. You know I love you)  The point is though, that I am passionate about programming.  I spend nearly all my free time trying to learn programming and improve on what I do know.  I am lucky enough to have a girlfriend that knows I am passionate about this, and that all the work I am putting in will hopefully lead to us being able to have a better future.</p>
<p>Not everyone is as lucky as I have gotten.  If your passionate about learning programming you will find a way.  The internet is full of stories of people that have taught themselves how to program and have succeeded at it.  It is simply awe inspiring what some of those people had to do, or pull themselves out of, in  order to learn how to program.  They had passion though, and if you really, truly, are passionate about learning how to code and how to understand “The Matrix”, then I have little doubt that you can succeed at it as well.    
</p>
<p>
	Ok, so you have the passion to become a programmer.  You have been obsessed with computers your entire life and are ready to take the leap and learn how to code, but have you got the patience to not quit when thing start going bad?  Do you also have the persistance to see your journey to learning to program all the way to the end?  You might think patience and persistance are one and the same, but you are wrong.  Patience is defined as, <i><strong>The quality of being patient, as the bearer of provocation, annoyance, misfortune, or pain.  Withought complaint, loss of temper, irritation, or the like.</strong></i>  As a programmer, being patient is going to be an extremely valuable skill.  You are going to end up being all of those negative thiong listed in the definition multiple times.... in just one project more than likely.  You have to be patient though, and not overreact.  This is especially important at the beginning of your journey.  You are going to stare, and stare, and stare at that Matrix shit and figure out what it does.  Your going to try to figure out code for so long your eyes might dry out and start cracking like its chapped lips, and you know what?  You are still not going to understand it.  Eventually you will, but at the beginning you are going to get EXTREMELY frustrated.  Just have patience and persistant and stick with it though.  
</p>
<p>
	Now, you are being very patient.  You are understanding that it is not all going to come to you at once, and there is going to be lots of pain and frustration while learning how to program and to understand all that gibberish.  You just got a new job though and you are super tired everyday when you get home from work.  You are just going to turn off that screen with all the Matrix writing for awhile and you'll get back to it tomorow.  Tomorow comes and you think "I am tired again, I think I am just going to put off studying programming for awhile, just till I get used to my new job".  If you happen to do something akin to the scenario I just described, you are more than likely going to end up either just giving up, or having to start over in learning everything when you decide to pick it back up again.  This is because you did not have the persistance to see this journey through to the end.  
</p>
<p>
	Persistance is extremely important at the beginning of your journey to learning programming, and stays important throughout.  Persistance is defined as, <i><strong>To continue steadfastly or firmly in some state, purpose, or course of action, or the like.  Especially in opposition, remonstrance, etc.</strong></i>  I have spent the better part of an entire day trying to figure out what is wrong with my code, only to find out I had placed an errant quotation mark in there that broke the entire thing.  Without patience and persistance I would have gave up on that program, probably thinking to myself that I would get back to it tomorow, and more than likely never coming back to it.  If you want to understand the Matrix then you had better be persistant.  Programming is hard.  You are going to be spending an awful lot of time staring at your screen trying to figure out why your program isn't running.  You are going to fail.  Then you will fail again.  Then you'll fail again, and again, and again.  All those failures are important though.  Learning what doesn't work is just as important as figuring out what does work.  You are going to have to be patient, to be able to sit there for hours staring at your code not working, and you are going to need the persistance to keep going afterwords no matter how frustrated and defeated you feel.  You are going to need to be able to do all of that and then be able to say to yourself "I am going to figure this out, and after I do I WANT MORE.  The Matrix will not defeat me!"
</p>
<p>
	All of that patience and persistance will pay off.  After the many hour you just spent frustrated at your JavaScript code for not doing what you wanted it to do, and cursing the name Brendan Eich (The creator of JavaScript), you will finally get it to work.  You will feel such a great sense of accomplishment that you are going to want to run outside and give hugs and high-fives to strangers.  Seeing all those hour of work, all the patience you had, and the persistance to not give up and see it through to the end, you deserve to go get those hugs and high-fives.  If no one is around to give them to you, just contact me.  I will give you all the praise yopu deserve.  Hell, if you live close enough to me I'll drive over to you and give you those hugs and high-fives myself.
</p>
<p>
	Ok, so we have established that you are passionate about technology and learning to program.  You know that this all is not going to be a cakewalk, and you are ready to be patient with yourself.  You are going to go line by line and google every single part of your code until you find an answer. You understand you are going to fail, and fail a lot, until you finally get it and then scream to the world "BRING ON MORE!", because you are a persistant person.  You don't let yourself give up when the going gets tough, and you are ready to sit and figure out all the problems this journey has to throw at you.  What else could you possibly need?  You need drive and determination.  These 2 are more or less mindsets that go along with passion, patience, and persistance, but are just as, if not more, important.
</p>
<p>
	In order to be able to understand and manipulate The Matrix, you will need drive and determination.  Drive, other than being what you do with a car, is defined as <i><strong>an innate, biologically determined urge to attain a goal or satisfy a need,</strong></i> and determination is defined as <i><strong>firmness of purpose; resoluteness.  a tendency to move in a fixed direction.</strong></i>  I believe both of these mindsets are actually more important the older you get.  When you are young, you don't have all the responsibilities that come with being an adult. (I should say, most young people out there don't have that level of responsibility.  There are also plenty of young people that are put in the same spot as adults.)  Being an adult means a career to worry about to pay the bills.  You have to take care of your children.  You also have to make sure you have time for your signicant other and keep up the house (Those tickets for your lawn being too high are costly.)  These are all things that come with being an adult and all of them take priority over anything else in your life, including learning to program.  It's just so easy to say that you're tired, or that you don't have the time to devote to learning a new skill (especially such a hard and time consuming one as programming.)  I know, it's rough having all these responsibilities.  I am not some kid, I am a 32 year old adult myself.  Although I am sure plenty of people would argue that point.  When I feel like I don't have the time or energy to do something though, I think about this quote from H. Jackson Brown Jr.<br>
				<br><i><strong><q id="time">
				Don't say you don't have enough time.  You have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Helen Keller, Pastuer, Michealangelo, Mother Teresa, Leonardo DaVinci, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstien.
				</q></strong></i><br><br><br><br><br>
That is one of my very favorite quotes, and perfectly encapsulate my point as well.  These great minds all had even greater drive and determination.  Think about Helen Keller for a minute.  She wrote a book, lectured to other great minds, and graduated from Radcliffe College.  She was also FREAKING BLIND AND DEAF!!!  Your long work day doesn't really compare to what she must to have gone through, but she had the drive and determination to do all these things and succeed at them.
</p>
<p>
	Do you understand what I am trying to tell you here?  There is really NO EXCUSE to great that you can't sit down to practice everyday.  Even if you can only practice for 10 minutes, DO IT!  Eventually sitting down to practice will become habit, and you will genuinly feel bad if you miss a day of practice.  Especially when you are first starting out, you need to have that same drive and determination that Helen Keller had to communicate.  I am in no way trying to belittle what Helen Keller did by comparing it to this, but really, you are doing the same thing.  Learning to communicate.  The difference being that instead of learning to communicate with people, you are learning to communicate with machines.
</p>
<p>
	Let me just tell you now.  You are going to fail.  You are going to fail a lot.  Learning to program is going to get harder and harder as you move on to more advanced concepts.  You are going to feel frustrated and defeated often.  You are going to feel like you have been doing so much work, but you are getting nowhere, and you've been staring at that damn Matrix shit on your screen for 3 months and still can't write a simple program by yourself.  You're going to want to just throw away all of your electronics and go move in to a shack in the woods, far away from it all.  Then, right when you're about to give it all up, something will "click".  Let me tell you, that moment when it finally clicks, and you are understanding that screen with the gibberish is one of the greatest feelings in the world.  You're not a programmer yet, but you understand what you are looking at now, and that is half the battle.  If you made it that far than go crack a beer and congratulate yourself.  You're passion, drive, determination, patience, and persistance have gotten you farther than probably 90% of the people that have sat down to try to learn programming, and then realized "Holy crap, this is hard, I am just going to continue flipping burgers for the rest of my life because it's easy and I am comfortable."(Not that there is anything wrong with flipping burgers, I did it myself for awhile.)  Just getting to the point where you can understand the code on your screen is going to be frustrating and hard.  Once you do understand it though, I would bet that there is nothing that will be able to keep you away from it.  
</p>
<p>	Everyone that has ever learned to program has been right there in your shoes.  Frustrated, the feeling that you will never understand it, and feeling totally defeated by the code.  Muhammad Ali once said,
<q><strong><i>Don't quit.  Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.</i></strong></q>  That quote couldn't be more true, when it comes to programming, or boxing, or any skill you want to learn.  Trust me though.  If you have the passion to want to learn programming.  The drive to act on that passion and start on your journey.  The patience to sit and stare at The Matrix until you finally understand it.  The persistance to fail, and fail, and fail, and fail again, but keep coming back for more.  AAs well as the determination to see your journey all the way until your a real programmer, without losing your passion, patience, or drive.  Then I have faith that you will succeed.  Suddenly the Matrix will look like a blonde, brunette, and a red-head.    </p>
